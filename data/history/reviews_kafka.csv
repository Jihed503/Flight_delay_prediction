A very nice terminal  recent  modern  comfortable. The trip by bus to Tirana (there are no train  tram or metro) is less comfortable and can take from half an hour to nearly one hour according to traffic  which is hectic in town at the rush hours.,tia


Lounge was closed without prior notice neither from the airline (Lufthansa)  airport  lounge or PriorityPass. Very chaotic and unorganized airport.,tia


In 2023 still not admit the digital boarding pass. You have to go to the fate to print the boarding pass,tia


Tirana’s airport is way too small compared to the number of visitors  alltough you can spot some nice plane such as Embraers  CRJ’s etc.. 3/5,tia


The immigration staff are rude and impersonal. Atm's charge a small fortune to withdraw cash however the exchange rate is extremely good at the kiosk! Wifi is awful and rarely works.,tia


No on-line check-in for BA services so had to use check-in desk. Security was an absolute nightmare with very long queues and fast track suspended because security was so busy – just when you actually need fast track. Lounge very hot and fairly poor selection of food. Boarding by bus only.,tia


We asked the lady at the check in for a window like 5F and she gave it to me. Than at the security they controlled us and no problems. We ate something at the Bar there waiting for the Boarding to start. We went at the airplane with busses. Small but a modern and nice airport. Overall rating 10/10,tia


Пассажиров на рейс в Киев не пускали в аэропорт со всеми  они должны были стоять на улице.,tia


The first international airport where you can not pay with credit card  only with cash. If you do not have albanian lek  you can pay usa dollar as well  just charge more. Terrible airport!,tia


Queues were rather long  which meant that there was a lot of waiting around. However  the staff were friendly and there were plenty of seats to sit in while we waited for the line to shorten so that we could board.,tia


This time around  the highlight of Tirana was the speed of security. There were many personnel there standing by to assist us and make sure that everything moved along smoothly. Previously  there have been long waits due to understaffing and a lack of efficiency; there was none of that this time around. Check-In  however  was understaffed - there need to be more people to be on the desks. WiFi? What WiFi?,tia


Check-In was extremely crowded. There were three lines open for our flight  and yet the queues were still much longer than normal. WiFi sucked  as usual  so I set up and used a mobile hotspot. The lounge was comfortable enough  and the prices in the Duty Free were as they are elsewhere in Tirane. We had to pay 400 lek for an orange juice though  which was way too pricey  despite how delicious it was.,tia


The only chance to have something to drink or eat before your flight after passing the security check are two coffees with higher prices then you would pay within Tirana city. WiFi is some kind of mystery  sometimes you have some connection and then it strikes again.,tia


First time ever everybody had to go though costums with x-ray and full programme. Maybe because it was the flight from Turkey. Sadly after 19h there is no public bus to the city anymore  so you are forced to take a cab,tia


There is some wifi avialable  but somehow it has no connection to the internet. Within "rush hour" the que for Security check can take you 15-20 minutes.,tia


Immigration takes ages. They have some capacity problems during "rush-hour". On the other hand you don't have to wait for your luggage anymore.Only a few steps and you are in the bus to the City,tia


Its a small airport. Its very new and fresh too. Its very easy to find your gates and check in desks. Crew is helpful. You always board by bus.,tia


Is very simple small and practical . I recommend it to visit you once in life and also to have the experience ... Its very good airport :) ............................. .......... ...c yx a as as as,tia


Its a new airport and one of the biggest on the Balkan. I like it. It's preety nice. And the people are very polite :) To bad that there is not an airline based in albania. I hoper they make the airport bigger. It's almost to small..,tia


♥,tia


Its a new airport  i like it but it has many delays  you can pass your time at Duty Free or drinking a coffee but there are not many shops. Getting to the airport its very hard you should find a taxi and the prizes are very high and the bus every hour is very hard to find. WI-FI is good,tia


Very stupid place.After the bus many peoples wait on outside of airport . Hundreds of passangers ( and we ) expected 2 hours for passport control and I cant see any airport personels for ask why we are waiting ...I hope  I never fly to Albania,tia


The new airport is built by the people who did KLIA and is fresh and modern. An immense improvement on the old shed at Rinas that was used before.,tia


This flight was a great flight for me and my family flying to Algeria  arriving to Algiers and departing from there was excellent  i think this airport coming from my preference has a huge potential into being one of the best airports in Africa and globally  its also quite clean and i always see cleaners around mopping the floor  the building was quite modern and huge but there was quite a lack of entertainment for the children.,alg


Good airport  modern  but please be aware that the immigration might take a lot of time for non-Algerians  so be on time on departure!,alg


Incredibly there is no internal connection between the International and the Domestic Terminal. Moreover the passengers must collect their luggage at international and chack in again at Domestic terminal  after a half kilometer walk olong the street.,alg


Inbound flight to ALG on a Saturday so road traffic was light. Immigration is so slow. Arrived at the same time as QR - that was an hour gone. Another 45 minutes for luggage. Could do better! I wonder what the departure process will be like?,alg


This is the best airport in Africa :D ....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................,alg


اللي بلاه ربي يجوزعلى مطار شكوبيستان الدولي ....ً.... ........................................................................................................................................,alg


Excellent very bright  best in north Africa ...nice airport Algiers / Houari Boumediene . très propre  passage rapide au niveau de l'immigration  Bagages en 10 minutes. sans doute le meilleur en afrique du nord.,alg


Excellent: I like this airport. Profissional and kind immigration/customs staff. Quick processing in both ways: no time lost  no long queues  just few minutes to go through all controls. Wifi is available but not for free: WIFI access cards can be purchased from stores inside airport.,alg


One of the nicest in Africa  very bright and clean. It still needs some improvements such as more shops and restaurants  but in overall it is a very nice and comfortable airport. Besides  it will be soon linked with Algiers underground system  which is a very good thing  given the prices asked by some taxi drivers...,alg


as i flight attendant i find DAAG's new look one of the best in Africa   more than this   the services provided are quite fine   they do the job  maybe the problem that faces passengers is related to security and check   here sleeps the difficulty  but except check.. everything is alright and so fine just make sure you fly with Tassilli airlines to enjoy your trips ...,alg


The airport  in general  is quite good but has to be underlined that the passport control open only at 3:30 in the morning and VIP Lounge also. So  if you arrive at the airport earlier than this time  you have to wait outside the departure area. The airport/company staff  often don't take care  at gate  about the respect of priority lanes. This is not to much comfortable. Security baggage check is probably insufficient and  in any case  not recognized as such  by major european and american airport.,alg


I just have no choice because there is no other airport in Algiers. If you travel in the summer you have to be very very patient. They must do more for the passengers. One other thing: I wonder where they have found the customs officers... I was also surprised to see a very huge poster of the Algerian president  I thought I was in North Korea!,alg


good airport but can do more,alg


Bon aéroport - Bagages arrivés rapidement - Parking gratuit,alg


A very great Airport   I loved it !,alg


good and nice airport!,alg


Very good african airport,alg

Although this is a small airport  I waited longer than 1 hour for my baggage. The worst service throughout the world. There is no seat at baggage reclaim  no food service,czl


Aéroport pas moderne et sale  le personnel est horrible ! à fuir  je deteste cet aéroport degeulasse digne des années 70.,orn


A nice little airport mainly serving national carrier Taag  CABGOC charter Dash8 and military cargo flights. Existing terminal has a dedicated lounge for CABGOC travellers with Tea/Coffee and toilet facilities while waiting for flight. Arrival hall is a bit congested with emmigration counters  luggage carrousels etc in the same hallway.,cab


What is the use of tagging the business class passenger bags when the wait for collection is exactly the same as economy passengers. Business class have the privilege to leave the flight first and then wait with all other passengers for luggage. The Priority sticker does not mean anything in this instance.,lad


The lounge has no toilet  the toilet on the airport is a mess  with no paper and sinks with no water or broken. There's no much option for food. The service connection system and staff are confusing. And there's no wifi on the airport.,lad


Smooth check in  need to triage passengers. Business and First Class passengers to be given the necessary treat. Security check staff unfriendly and hold no respect for passengers. Talk to each other and pay no attention if not 100% focus on serving the passengers.,lad


Avoid TAAG and Luanda Airport ! such a mess  rude staff  aircraft in such a bad conditions with cabin not doing safety demo and seat are so hard that it feel like it’s wood  and the wall is falling into pieces. I’ve never been scared of flying before and as an Ex cabin crew this is scary to see.,lad


Se por um lado o avião estaciona junto ao aeroporto nacional (uma vantagem)  por outro fica-se mais de uma hora a espera das bagagens. On one side there was an improvement because the plane is now stopping near the baggage claim area but the time we wait for the baggage for an hour is not admissible,lad


Poor Airport waiting  poor information. No free wifi and if you want to smoke then most to pay for it. Unconfortable and all drinks cost not normal,lad


horrible... toilets are disgusting... Only reason i was here was for work. Staff are rude  refuse to speak English. esspecialy when they have an issue with your yellow fever stamps. Make sure you have this up to date before getting here and clear. took 2 hours to get through customs  could not be bothered to put more people on to help out... all sat in a corner having a chat about us poor folk standing there like sheep for 2 hours,lad


The airport is small for the number os passengers that have now a days but is very nice. So comfortable. Most of the Toilets are out of order,lad


You are lucky if you are not arrested by the angolan immigration at your arrival acused to have a fake visa  just because they don't have their system updated. If at your arrival your name is not in the immigration service system the conclusion for them is obvious: Your visa is fake and for sure you are trying to enter in Angola to still oil and diamonds. Surreal country...,lad


This is without a doubt the worst airport I have ever been to. The service is terrible  customs is corrupt  and so is the rest of the facilities. No good food available  only bad food. Check inn i horrible. Border control is rude  and way to slow. I have no positive things to say about this airport. Even thought it underwent some modification  the toilets still smell like piss. And that is not a good smell in an heated airport. Do not go there unless really needed.,lad


Improved a lot but border control still slow,lad


This airport needs improvements in all aspects,lad


It's available to exchange currency in this airport  but you have to use a cash. The course of exchanging somewhere about equal with course in exchanging points in city centre. There are no buses from Shirak Airport to Gyumri  you have to go by taxi  it takes about 15 minutes and costs about 2$,lwn


Aérodrome plus qu aéroport. Installations vétustes. Tapis à bagages d un autre âge qui jette en dehors autant de bagages qu il en transporte. Arnaques aux transferts en ville tolérées pour des pseudo-taxis sales et chers. Tout est à revoir sinon je crains pour la seule liaison quotidienne,lwn


Yerevan airport is 30 minutes away from the city. Immigration queues are long but manageable. Food options are limited and expensive. Duty free is good enough. Beer is cheaper than water in this airport which was weird.,evn


The options for meals and beverages after the security check are limited at best  with horrendously inflated prices.,evn


シンプルな空港。でも警察官も案内スタッフもみんな親切で、いろいろ助かった。,evn


No announcements in English. WiFi did not Work. Behind the security check no restaurants. One bar was was closed  the other one had only bad quality but expensive snacks.,evn


Bus no.17 and no. 18 runs directly to the city center  which is more cheaper than the taxi. One way costs with big luggages only 300 AMD (0 50€),evn


Zvartnots has become a modern  safe  comfortable airport. In terms of security and electronic services it is better than many European airports. It is incomparable better than neighbor country airports. I would love to see more flights with Armenian carriers. Very nice  modern airport  always well treated. staff good command of knowledge of foreign languages,evn


to BM ... they have a modern airport only for people and not turkeys. if u r a racist (fascist) tell the people firstly who you are... u can tell the people how a turkey eet grass ............................................................................... ------------------------------------------------------------------,evn

My lovely modern airport,evn


great service  fantastic-built modern airport! congds,evn


Graz is both modern and delightfully old-fashioned. While the train station is a few hundred meters outside the airport  it's easy to walk there via a paved  lit  and covered walkway. Just be aware that there are NO elevators at the station  in case you arrive by train and have heavy luggage. There are ramps though. As for the airport itself  the terminal is nice and modern  but also very compact. The airside is equally compact  and all gates are walk or bus gates. The business class lounge is accessed via a dedicated staircase or elevator  although the access is a little hard to find. Food and drink options are a bit limited  but generally of good quality  and the views over the airfield are pretty damn impressive indeed. Speaking of views  the airport has a freely accessible viewing deck on the first floor. No security check  you can just walk straight out. More airports should have that!,grz


Klein - schnell!,grz


Excellent airport!,grz


Nice SMALL airport!,grz


Very nice  small and well organized airport. No direct train connection  but in 10min walking distance.,grz


Nice airport,grz


Longest time at security and no fast track  but best and cosiest star alliance lounge in the network!,inn


It is a very small airport but still cosy and enjoyable. A small duty free area as soon as you entered was available and baggage claim was quick and easy.,inn


If flight arrival in evening is delayed and last bus missed closely  that last bus SHOULD have to wait for approx. 50 passengers. Also  there were only some 4-5 taxis for those at least 50 passengers  hence huge cues and waiting times. Generally  very bad organisation.,inn


Much weather delayed flight held on apron for stand and then a wait for bus to take 30m to terminal. Cramped customs and worse baggage reclaim  not suitable for number of passengers coming in. Departures and external the same. Stunning approach though.,inn


Small regional airport  which is beautiful located in the heart of the alps and stunning views... Everything you need for a smooth departure - quick  friendly check-in staff - definitely coming back again!,inn


I wasn't expecting much as it is very small but it was totally what I expected. Not somewhere I'd want to be for 3 or 4 hours but an efficient airport with absolutely breathtaking views. The terrace to watch the planes from is amazing with the backdrop of the Alps. Not much to do apart from a small shop air side and a very small cafe. Easy access to the main town  bus F takes you from the terminal straight to the centre or Innsbruck in 20 mins. No hassle!,inn


It is not a big airport but got everything you need. It's in Austria so I was used to the high prices already. Nice and clean airport in a beautiful city that's a few minutes away. It's located between the mountains  which is amazing to see while landing.,inn


Delayed due fog.,inn


B-E-A-U-T-I-F-U-L!!!!,inn


Windy landing  uncomfortable approach,inn


Terrasse wurde verbaut...,inn


Small airport with few flight per day and at the terminal everything is at short distance. Bag drop  security check and border control is very fast and staff is very friendly. Only one small duty free shop  but that's because whole airport is small. Parking is cheap in comparison with other Austrian airports.,klu


For a small airport  it has everything required. It is a short busride from town center  but no rail connection. There is a small retail outlet directly between security control and the departure gate. A small baggage reclaim area leads directly to a taxi rank. Clean and staff are usually pleasant.,klu


Very small but friendly airport. Landing approach is amazing  wait times are very short. wish there were more connections to 1-2 hour destinations. great landscape and surrounding. don't expect super fancy facilties though.,klu


SMALL AND NICE  GREAT VIEW!,klu


Had to stand in bitter cold queuing up to get into the arrivals section. Only one immigration officer on duty to check passports.,klu


Small Airport  very clean and friendly,klu


Small airport. Ideal if flight is on time but limited facilities to cope with delays. LT car park expensive.,klu


Regional-Airport  durch regelmäßige Anbindung an FRA mit vielen Zielen verbunden. Kurze Wege  rasche Gepäckaufgabe. Security-Check <2 min. -> Kurzum: sehr angenehm  von dort zu reisen!,lnz


Reasonable for a small airport. Only a small cafe beyond security control but the restaurants in the main building are sufficient and provide enough variety. Security staff tend towards the friendly.,lnz


Mein liebster und auch gleichzeitig mein Heimatflughafen. Schnelle Abfertigung  Keine langen Fusswege  Freundliches Personal Saubere Toiletten Innerhalb von 5 Minuten vom Parkplatz am Gate! Direkt ab Linz gibt es zwar nicht die große Anzahl an Destinations  aber über Frankfurt wird einem dann das Tor in die ganze Welt eröffnet.,lnz


Schnelle Abfertigung  freundliches Personal  großes Angebot - netter Flughafen,lnz


Sehr schnelle Abfertigung  15 min vor Abflug am airport  noch mitgeflogen.,lnz


Sehr kleiner flughafen wirkt sehr ausgestorben personal im cafe unfreundlich keine möglichkeit zigaretten zu kaufen.,lnz


Eigen Charter,lnz


The airport is moderate size  nothing crazy. It is neat and has everything you need  but nothing special.,szg


Deplaning in small groups due to local restrictions but then the whole plane getting packed into one bus. So stupid... We were waiting long to get our COVID-documents checked. There was a big crowd waiting in the queues without distances. At same time flight of Turkish Airlines arrived. So many people not wearing their masks  but no one cares. Silly silly,szg


Typical Austrian Airport. Good restaurant upstairs whilst waiting. The lady on the cash desk charged me €256:00 instead of €26:60 which I did not notice until I got my credit card bill! Contacted the airport by email and got the difference refunded without any problem - nice.,szg


Wie immer ankommen  ein kurzer Weg übers Rollfeld und Du bist an dem Kofferband. Dann noch mal 5 Minuten und Du stehst vor dem Flughafen. Besser geht es nicht!,szg


Airport is completely out of its depth dealing with ski flights during the season. Place is manic with no space  organisation or coordination. Will try to avoid airport in future.,szg


Nach dem Bau einer kleinen Lounge für Staralliance und Oneworld Gäste ist der Flughafen jetzt komplett. Die Security für Lounge Gäste funktioniert hervorragend  die Lounge (wenn auch klein) erfüllt gut seine Zwecke. Der Rest des Flughafens war schon immer sehr gut. Das einzige was SZG nicht hinbekommt ist ein Prioboarding bei LG  AUA und AB.,szg


Wie immer mit Handgepäck ist das Verlassen der Maschine einfach super. Schnell übers Rollfeld ins Parkhaus und man sitzt in unfassbar schnellen 10 Minuten im Auto. Einfach prima! Wenn das immer so wäre dann wäre SZG mein Favoriten Airport in Europa,szg


SZG is the perfect Airport for frequent Flyer. From the car port to the security is less than 5 minutes. Yes there is no Lounge for Status Flyer but it´s ok. Mostly you enter the Airolane by foot and this means you see the great landscape of mountains around Salzburg.,szg


Nice little Airport  bit hard to reach but it`s ok  really nice designed Airport. You have free Wifi  which is great. There are not that many food shops but the lounge is comfortable. It`s easy to get through customs and to your baggage claim. Nice!,szg


Lousy airport. Thight crammed check in area with long ques. Very long security lines. Took almost an hour to get through. Poor food and retail services in a small and crowded departure area. It also has bus gates.,szg


The airport of Salzburg is all in all a great airport to fly to. The staff is very helpfull and effective  as a reason of the airport size Check-In works fast and the way to the gate is quite short. Really interesting is also the visitors platform with a great view of the runway and the airplane-movement. WiFi is available for free and works without any problems. For it´s size Salzburg offers a great variety of food and retail services  the only critical point is the terminal facility  which is a bit out of date. Watch our Salzburg experience on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k5f7AkTX6Y FlightExperience,szg


Very nice airport  small but great! Friendly Stuff  nice Food and retail services. Very good parking at the airport. Smokers corner available  free wifi on the airport. Nice and fast baggage claim at arrival.,szg


It won't win an award  but it is reasonable enough  and very easy to get to with the bus. In need of rehabilitation  everything is very grey. Has a post-office  pre-security. That has saved me a few times.,szg


Small but great airport. Free wifi  efficient security control and mostly not too crowded.,szg


Lovely little airport,szg


Homebase Airport,szg


Efficient and cosy!,szg


Just used the airport again and quite pleasant but it can get very crowded even if only 3 or so flights departing.,szg


Small but nice airport. Most of all  thank you for wifi service!,szg


Small airport. Very clean and nice but it needs more tax-free shops after the safety control and a little more space at the waiting areas at the gates.,szg


Nice airport to use  not to crowded  quick security and usually you can walk to the planes.,szg


WLAN kostenlos im Abflugbereich,szg


Great airport  very user friendly  been through quite a few times. Definitely recommended,szg


Well organised airport,szg


International Airport closed after 10pm. Everything is closed in the evenig and only limited train service to the city. Cheap Airport,vie


The airport is pretty basic. The duty free is just alcohol and perfumes. And the lounge was closed  the other lounge was overcrowded,vie


There is no proper queue for security check and people are crowded. Ground staffs has no clue how to manage the crowd and their wrong decisions make things worse. Took around 30 minutes to cross the security check.,vie


Terminal 1 is quite far from the airports trains station. Check-in desk opened awfully late  resulting in huge bagdrop queues. Vienna lounge is ok.,vie


Beim Transfer von Shanghai nach Berlin musste man unerwartet noch mal durch die Sicherheitskontrolle.,vie


Very straightforward! Arriving from the bus gate  we were dropped off right at the baggage claim. There were minimal delays with the baggage. You have the option to buy city train tickets right at the baggage claim  or you can buy your tickets at the train station.,vie


Absolute mismanagement of the crowd during security check. No wonder this is the country where Hitler is from,vie


Self check-in is a joke. You cannot print bagtags or boardingpasses  so whats the point? Slow manual checkin Terminal 1 is nice and lots of space. Contrary to other large airports in Europe  the gates actually has sufficient seating.,vie


At baggage (re)claim there were 4 flights on carousel. It is too much on 1 carousel. Also i think it is a correct airport.,vie


Panorama terrace is really cool place. There is a lot of modell plane on the corridor which made me so excited to visit this place. There is no glass instead of glass there is SRA check  so thats means you have to go through an addicional security check.,vie


Restrooms at the F gates are all downstairs and you have to use stairs which not very passenger friendly,vie


An easy to navigate airport with walkable connections between terminals. Getting to the airport is easier with train from central station where you could find convenient luggage lockers. Security check was quick.,vie


Quick connection from Schengen to non-Schengen. Lounge right behind border control was pretty nice  even tho a little crowded. Food was good at the lounge,vie


Signage is confusing; not enough space for people to move; everything seems somewhat makeshift; WiFi doesn't work,vie


Very nice airport for European Standards. Furthermore  the security check and immigration were very fast.,vie


Ryanair Int Airport. The airport is hardly recognisable  nothing works any more. There is no longer a 24/7 food area  only very limited service  the vending machine prices from the supermarket are more expensive than at the gate  Burger King closes very early and there are no alternatives. Furthermore  many flights are usually delayed in the evening  so that transport into the city is very limited or non-existent. The airport seems to be at the standard of London Heathrow  but is comparable to Warsaw Modling (Ryanair only).,vie


The Terminal 3 is a very modern and clean Terminal. The check-in area and the area before the security check has many useful stores. But after Emigration the Options to buy things is very limited and the prices are ridiculous. I paid 2 Euros for a 0.5l bottle of water. Also there aren't many stores in the forst place.,vie


Vienna Airport has suffered a great loss of performance since Covid. It has become a real disappointment on all levels. Especially the food and shopping facilities are constantly worsening. The new shops in the entrance area are a disgrace  everything is far too small  the security check-in takes far too long and is far too small. They want to be an international airport  but are adapting to Ryanair standards (the airline that is apparently very much preferred).,vie


Efficient airport. Quick to clear custom and arriving in baggage reclaim. Fast and efficient trains to city.,vie


Fast service  quick handling. Waiting time for luggage was a little long (very late and hardly any planes). The new Billa supermarket is a disgrace  but finally Costa Caffee. Unfortunately  the airport is getting worse in recent years with the food offer (only corporations and franchises  no locals).,vie


Out of my first 50 flights  40 have been through Vienna airport (arrival or departure). Getting to airport is easy no matter which transport mode you use. The checkin area is also well organized no matter T1 or T3. The WIFI works great without issues. There are several vending machines at all corners of the airport. The shopping options before boarding area are better than the ones inside. The food options are okayish  i do feel there is lack of variety in terms of cuisines and not many shops who cater to travelers with special dietary needs. The best feature of airport is visitors terrace which is open in spring and summer season. For 4 euros you can get a 2 hour access to the terrace and enjoy some sunshine and view of departing/arriving planes as well as ground operation at the airport. Only downside i see is lack of sitting places near some of the gates. Overall a very convenient airport  not too big not too small and the staff at airport is professional and helpful.,vie


The immigration was so AWFUL we had to ask to cut multiple people so we didn’t miss our flight and then had to run to our gate. Security was quick however.,vie


I am so glad we only spent on day in Vienna  bad attitudes  crappy service lots of attitude everywhere you go  next trip to Slovakia will fly through Prague or Budapest,vie


treated like criminals  crappy airport crappy location  crappy attitude  and the Moxy VIE is the worst hotel very a lot of money for a room the size of a broom closet,vie


Slow and unorganised security. Almost no power outlets available in terminal 3. In general staff not too interested in assisting travellers and some are borderline rude.,vie


Well thought out airport with newness all throughout the two terminals. Yet another hidden gem when it comes to reaching Europe through the back door,vie


very narrow corridors  no facilities after arrival  long waiting time at baggage claim area. poor connection to the city  taxi way too expensive.,vie


Very good airport  very fast terminal handling  many connections to the city (train  bus)  some long distances  but toilets everywhere  great lounge  there is enough space  etc. In my opinion a real 5 star airport  not like the bought 5 star airports in the Middle East.,vie


One of the best Airports in Europe. A lot of connections from the city to the airport  great Lounge  fast Security and everything on time,vie


Vienna airport is one of the top airports  it has an easy connection by train  a lot of food stores and a tunnel to walk to the hotels nearby (NH and Moxy) safe and dry. Everything is clean  beggars are only in the train station. Bring your food an coffee from outside the airport  your wallet will like it.,vie


The only good thing about Vienna Airport is its good accessibility. Otherwise  it is small  slow  overpriced and staff is not very kind.,vie


Good and straightforward navigation  stable Wi-Fi. Power sockets and drinking fountains would be appreciated.,vie


still no smmoking zone in Terminal 1. still no smmoking zone in Terminal 1. still no smmoking zone in Terminal 1.,vie


The refurbished Vienna Lounge @ T1 is great! Security check is most often fine in terms of waiting times  even in the morning peak. Fast WiFi. Only thing to complain about is somewhat limited seating in waiting areas.,vie


very clean even though terminal was small for our flight it had a nice italian restarsunt where we ould grab a quick bite before departure,vie


The new Vienna Lounge at T1 is great - all others at VIE incl. the small and cramped Austrian Airlines lounges look like ratholes compared to this 2500 sqm shiny new thing.,vie


Austrian airlines employees mostly clueless  rude and arrogant Overall  Vienna Airport has been declining in quality over the years. Sad  it was one of my favourite airports,vie


Very modern and beautiful airport  I loved it there! It's all clean and simple  I didn't even get lost in such a big place. It's also very goodly accessible by trains  it takes only 15 minutes to get to the main train station in Vienna.,vie


Katastrophale Lounges mit penetrantem Piepton  Mitarbeiter waren nicht interessiert zu helfen  unfreundliche und sehr unhöfliches Personal,vie


Blöde Schildkröte in der Lounge ... Die Olle war etwas nervig .. Ansonsten aber echt schön und okay,vie


Bit slow on immigration but at least I got an Austrian stamp this time. May add to this on my departure.,vie


Immigration was very quick and staff were friendly with them being very accommodating to a family with a small child in front. The terminal was clean and modern with adequate signage. Transport links were good  albeit biased towards the CAT with advertising extending throughout the terminal - alternative options could be better advertised for those who are new to the city and wish to save some money but the transport links at the airport were good.,vie


Beautiful airport accessed quickly by direct train from Vienna in 16 mins. Airport layout lovely with fast security and good retail and food outlets,vie


Very easy to get out - might of been the fact that it was very late at night but still very clean and convenient.,vie


Terminal 3 at VIE is one of the worst terminals I've ever seen! Most lavatories can only reached via stairs and need an immediate update to modern technology. The walking ways from the arrival gates to baggage claim are long and narrow.,vie


perfect  I have arrived several hours in advance  with no problem with getting through the security and spending the waiting time in the lounge area. The place is clean  English is no problem  very friendly folks .. and the wifi is around 200/200 Mbps .. well no complaints :),vie


Trotz business fast den Flug verpasst. Ganz schlechte Koordination - keine Ansagen trotz Verspätung und Gatewechsel. Sehr ärgerlich. Freches angemietetes Bodenpersonal beim Boarding,vie


The transit at Vienna airport is terrible. Arrogant and slow agents at passport check  boards are very confusing  the specific transit lines are closed  you are sent back to the exit and have to redo security. 2 stars because we made it anyway running here and there  but I would not reccommend a transit time less than 1 hour and by all means they should place more clear boards for transit.,vie


Currently very minimal service provided  most of retail stores and dining is closed. Stil very efficient handling.,vie


Viel zu weite Wege wenn man zu einem Non-Schengen Flug umsteigen muss oder umgekehrt. Auch der Bereich mit den Lounge ist je nach Gate sehr weit.,vie


due to Covid-19 regulations business class lounge open but for only take away food and drinks. however coffee was good,vie


One of my favorite airports in Europe  being easy to orientate  very friendly and pleasant. I love the shops selection and the Austrian lounges acing the tarmac. During transit  it's very easy to go out for some fresh are and even go to the supermarket for some reasonable prices local produce. The airport is not too big and the Schengen/non Schengen separation is very smart.,vie


Its an very nice big airport. You will find your gate in seconds. The visitor terasse is cheap and you will have an nice view over the Airport. Its great for spotting. There are many restaurants and other options,vie


The airport was horribly dirty  the ground was full of trash and the cleaning stuff just walked around laughing. I think that cleanliness is very important  especially that it was during the pandemic. One of the worst airport experiences ever.,vie


Nice and clean. Five star. Unfortunately though spending time at the airport during nighttime is a nightmare. No information office  no open shops  cafeteria nor restaurants. Seats are available  although armrests are not allowing passengers to have a rest  as if they did it on purpose in order not to take a nap. That is opposing to the fact that at the gates the seats have no armrests and they also have resting sofas/beds.,vie


Waiting some 15 minutes in the aircraft before the bus arrived. Other procedures quick and without any problem. Public bus schedules in front of terminal out of date - some lines missing  some obsolete. Spar closed in the evening.,vie


Nice Airport and new Terminal (3)  cheap and fast transfer to the city (EUR 4 20 via S-Bahn or Railjet  dont take the CAT),vie


Vienna has all the facilities but the airport with Austrian Airlines maintains a ridiculous 25 min connection time which is virtually impossible to make. Lounges are decidedly average in my view  apart from Air Canada.,vie


When coming from non-Schengen to Schengen flights  you need to go *again* through security. Pretty useless and a loss of time,vie


Vienna Schwechat is very well-organized airport  easy to navigate with lots of signs. Staff is super friendly and welcoming. Food inside the security area is limited and expensive.,vie


Very fast security check as always  easy to navigate and well designed. Pier D needs some renovation  but beside  the airport has everything needed and there are very few queues most of the time.,vie


A poorly-built half-terminal that is the result of terrible political decisions. The escalators are too narrow  the passport control area for both arrivals and departures is botched  and all movement along the building will require multiple escalator usage. Dark and unsatisfactory. Most checkin is performed by self-checkin devices with bad interfaces  while most of the airport staff in the checkin area seem to only be there to harass passengers. Little choice in food  which is overpriced  and the restaurants are understaffed with no interest in getting food to you in the times considered appropriate for a transit area.,vie


Terminal D is way too bad. There are no places to seat while you wait for your flight before the gate to be assigned. You have to seat on the floor.,vie


A half-built (literally) financial disaster with cramped escalators and one-way travelators  with almost non existent services beyond security control.,vie


Toilets in the airport are just embarrassing. Small  overcrowded  Cabins are small. And even no hook for the coat or a bag pack.,vie


2+ hours' waiting time for the luggages - no information  no help  no paper issued by ground handling. unacceptable!,vie


One of the greatest airports to fly. Easy access by train/bus  people there very friendly. Wifi working perfect. Many food options. 24h vending machines for overnight connections. Very clean. Plenty of toilets. Drinking water. Chargers plugs and USB below the seats.,vie


Access to the airport is perfect  great connection to highway. I actually didn't like that check in desks were in different terminal building than the departure gate was. Quick check in with 3 desks. System of security is twisted  absolutely! Before each gate is security point  no logic for me  employees seemed they do not want to work  opened security 50min before departure  not enough! At this terminal  I found one food service  more or less with baguettes and muffins.,vie


The airport is reasonably close to the city and it is easy to get there. Reclaim and Immigration (as well as luggage handling on arrival) are among the most efficient I have ever seen. Unfortunately the newest terminal (Terminal 3  opened in 2012) is a very badly designed terminal. Very modern and effective airport.,vie

Unfortunately the newest terminal (Terminal 3  opened in 2012) is a very badly designed terminal. Waiting lounges are waaay too small  no toilets close to the gates (if you have a gate at the very end of the terminal  you have about 200m to the next toilet  which is only reachable via stairs)  and the colors are completely unfriendly. The older terminal 1 is by far the nicer terminal.,vie


Air Lounge at Terminal 3 is average compared to airline dedicated lounges. If Qatar had their own lounge there  it would be a much better experience. Air Lounge is shared witha few airlines and this drops the standard a little.,vie


I´ll say Schwechat is my favourite airport. Always really happy to take off and land in Vienna. Very modern and effective airport. A lot of very good options to fly from Vienna. I love airport facilities and its connection to their customers. Also services like check in and security check is quite fast and you can always meet nice personal with the smile on their faces working for you.,vie


Austrian lounge was very busy  not the best layover I have had. Reasonable selection of food and drink  and if it were not so busy there would have been great apron views.,vie


During my connection  I had to go through security twice even though I was on air-side. I will avoid VIE at all cost! Really badly designed medium size airport.,vie


Very nice airport. Always a pleasure to depart from VIE. Nice architecture and simple orientation. Fast security check. Very nice restaurants and shops in duty free zone. Haven´t tried lounges yet but I hope I can sometimes. :),vie


Very good and easy access to the airport by train if flight departs/arrives during the day (8am-10pm)  4 trains per hour from Vienna Central Station (Wien Mitte) plus 2 more from Main Station (Wien Hbf). During the night  unfortunately there are no train nor bus services  which is totally not understandable. New terminal (T3) is too dark  has way too little seating in gate areas and only few shops and restaurant  surely not sufficient for an airport of 30 million pax per annum. Wifi is free and works quite well. Baggage claim area can get overcrowded at times  is too small for the size of the airport. Also  only very few shops/restaurants at arrivals. Concourse D for non Schengen flights (T1) is nasty  however will be refurbished next year.,vie


I arrived from Serbia  got through passport check  then wanted to go to F gates  took like 25 minutes  had to take the bus transfer  although my friends with non EU passport got there in like 15 minutes without bus transfer. Transfer guy asked for boarding pass which I didn't have because I was booked on the flight by Air Serbia after cancelled flight.,vie


Nice  clean airport with good markings (instruction arrows). Low cost airlines have check-in in  let's say  slightly less reachable area  behind the landside road in front of the terminal building. But that's no surprise in compare to other airports  too. There is enough of seating in terminals but I would also appreciate something softer  more comfortable for night waiting  which you will not find here. Transport between the city of Vienna and the airport is high-level by modern green "CAT train". It takes 15-20 minutes. Price over 10€. WiFi on the airport works well and you don't have to sign up anywhere to connect. Most of toilets are downstairs  what may be a problem for less mobile persons. Information desk was hard to find for me. The styling of the airport is quite dark  what may some people don't like.,vie


The airport was too far away from the city and the taxi was expensive. Installations were nice and clean.,vie


The ground handling (check-in and boarding) could be faster. But I know the whole industry is short on people.,vie


Vienna Airport  although quite new  is a little cramped and crowded. Small corridors and the lack of daylight and open space is not really state-of-the art for a newly build airport. On the other hand  it's one of the few airports that can handle changing times below 45 minutes perfectly without stressing the passenger. Immigration is well organised and baggage delivery is one of the fastest I've seen on and international airport of this size.,vie


Routing is a bit weird. Prices of food and drinks are over te top  Cakes at de Demel shop are from excellent quality.,vie


Skylink is a mess. Badly planned  badly executed. X-ray Scanners directly before the boarding gate prevent you from taking your bottle of cola onto the flight.,vie


Nice and clean airport  modern and convenient. However  lounges are usually overcrowded as well as the airport itself. Looks like it needs major extension.,vie


There are different lounges for different terminals at the Vienna airport. The one at 3 was nice  but the heating was a little too much. I was feeling hot inside the lounge literally. The attendants are very courteous and the food and beverage quality is also good  though a little limited.,vie


We used terminal 1 with C piers. As checkin was done online and we had only hand luggage  we went directly to security check. This was quick  staff was nice. Wifi on the airport is good and quick  there are many shops and facilities there. Generally  we like to travel from/to VIE  one of my preferred airports definitely.,vie


A distinct lack of smoking facilities  despite being in a liberal country regarding smoking. F-concourse of Terminal 3 has only one smoking area  and it's at the very end of the terminal building. Otherwise all is well at VIE.,vie


One of my favorite airports. Clean and modern  staff is friendly. Security check is pretty crowded.,vie


thats the most worse airport im ever been. the checkin and control is a joke  never had so unfriendly and arrogant people seen in my life before. that will get big trouble for Austrian Airline and the other stuff. i do now try to never fly again over that airport . big red X,vie


Qatar crew checked us in after a mere 40 minute wait when there were only about 5 families in front of us. This is in Europe and a 5-star airline  not Ryanair... The terminal is built in a way  that the security check is right at the gate  so you have no way of taking any of the "cheap" drinks you can buy inside the airport on-board. WTF!,vie


Horrendous airport. Most arrivals and departures are being done using buses. The toilet facilities are really scarce and were dirty.,vie


Wasn't there for a long time since I was connecting  but my experience was pleasant. Very easy to find your way around the airport and it was not to crowded.,vie


Free wi-fi without a password (+ arriving buses that also have free wi-fi ;) )  2 supermarkets and many more ;) You can get to the airport by foot or by bike from Fischamend. Minus - hard to find the power plugs.,vie


Shuttles (buses/trains  both) are overpriced - better to check trains (but not the airport shuttle trains)  regular tickets cost only 3 90€ what is cheapest way to get to the city and you can buy it in the ticket machine at the airport. They set out from the same station right on the airport.,vie


Anfahrt zum Flughafen fast immer eine kleine Katastrophe. Die Stehplätze die eigentlich nur zum Aussteigen gedacht sind sind fast immer von Mietwagen oder parkenden Autos besetzt und somit muss man oft schon mal eine komplette Runde fahren um aussteigen zu können das ist absolut nicht ok und für einen Flughafen wie VIE eine Zumutung... Auch der Checkin und die Gepäckaufgabe hat sich durch die Automaten sehr ins negative verändert. Das gibt es zwar in anderen Ländern auch schon aber ich finde es nicht ok  dass man Leuten die zb noch nie geflogen sind zumutet  dass sie sich das Gepäck selber einchecken und bekleben... Dadurch geht sehr viel vom Service auf den Flughäfen verloren vor allem wenn man mal nicht genau weiß was zu tun ist...,vie


Fantastic airport  great modern design  easy to get to with train service to Wien  amazing facilities and efficient friendly staff. I especially liked the leather lounging sofas at the gates to relax on...,vie


The transfer was a surprisingly long walking tour and took a thousand turns. Last time was better  so three stars are the average of that. There's pleasant hangouts  but nothing special or super relaxing.,vie


Good airport for arrivals  terrible for departures. There were no food and retail services after we passed security  only a vending machine. The staff manning the gate were rude and have no clue about customer service.,vie


Vienna airport can be reached by train  you can take the more expensive CAT train or the cheap S-bahn train to the city center. very convenient.,vie


This airport (at least Terminal 1) is missing seats when you can wait overnight comfortly  I mean  there are few but it is not sufficient at all  and since there is huge increase in low cost flights  this should be improved ASAP. And also  the lack of electric outlets is for cry..,vie


Clean and amazing. Passport control was empty with only 2 staff there. Wi-Fi is not the best. I tried watching YouTube  but it buffered every 10 seconds for like 2 minutes. Toilets clean  but the downside is everything is expensive. Being at least €100 if your going to buy something,vie


Clean airport but with an awkward process: the duty-free shops and main airport facilities come first where; a major lack of facilities and lounge/seating areas after security.,vie


All in all a great airport. However  transiting from outside Schengen one has to go through the security check again and I have rarely experienced more zealous security checks than at VIE which is rather annoying  especially if you only have 40 minutes transit time.,vie


The Terminal 3 is very boring with little things to do. The only place to eat after the security check is Jamie Oliver's restaurants.,vie


Avoid if flying to on schengen countries. Tiny rooms after security (which is at gate). Broken toilet  no water fountain. Not enough seating. Garbage. This happened multiple times. I now have policy not to fly from this airport if I can avoid it,vie


I liked visitors terrace to watch tarmac and runways  plane taking-off or landing. I was little bit negatively surprised by entrance fee 5 EUR.,vie


The Jet lounge in terminal 1 is terrible and extremely small. I had a visit around 6pm  and it is super crowded and I even have nowhere to sit! The service and food quality only meet a fast food store standard  really unacceptable! I don't recommend people to visit!,vie


Busbording and unfortunately we had to wait 10 minutes closed at the hot bus because the plane wasn't ready for passengers as it was still cleaned:-(,vie


Always happy to fly from Vienna Schwechat airoirt. Modern and clean. Fast security check and very kind check-in agents.,vie


It is very easy to get to the airport if you take the CAT train which leaves Vienna every 30min and only takes 16min to get to the airport. The airport has some shops in the F finger  but not many and therefore not a big choice of shopping and eating  and it can cause long queues. The wifi is average but it cannot be accessed in all parts of the airport. There are enough toilets in the terminals. The lounge is quite comfortable and not very small but also not very big  they have a big variate of drinks  but not a very big variate of food. The baggage claim is very clean and the baggage is delivered quickly all the time.,vie


Pay attention that they really weigh your hand lugagge before security check! Business lounge for Gates G is a bit small and gets crowded at some points.,vie


Modern airport though called for boarding and then waited in a line for over 40 minutes at security as no security staff were there.,vie


Getting to the airport is fast and cheap but not clear at all  very hard to find out where and how to pay for the train and which train to take. Needing to be there at 4 AM  we chose Uber  only 30 euros. Airport is so beautiful  lounges are great and everything is perfect.,vie


A beautiful new terminal  but with very long ways to walk. This might be healthy but it is not very helpful if you have a short transition time.,vie


Vienna airport is great as long as you are flying out of the new terminal (Gates G and F). If you are stuck in the old one then make sure you are not there early as it's overcrowded and lacks enough seating and restaurant choices. There isn't even a decent coffee shop in the gate area where you can take your coffee to go. The new terminal is fantastic and it even features really clean sleeping beds if you have a longer connection. If you are flying out early in the morning but you are taking the last CAT train then you can either sleep at the hotel there or simply go through security and rest on the beds.,vie


Be aware  the Austrian lounge for gates G (Terminal 3  non-Schengen) is a really bad joke and basically useless before the 10-11 am departure crowd to the US. Not enough seats to sit  even the restroom capacity is underplanned  queues at the male (!!) restrooms. Also  as a major design flaw  the waiting/boarding area for G-gates is simply underplanned. There's about 50 seats in the gate area for a B777 plane of 300 capacity... Due to pre-boarding document checks necessary on flights to the US  they try to squeeze people into this area prior to boarding. Really poor passenger flow design.,vie


Within Schengen (European Union inner flight) the travellers from germany were pushed also 2nd time (first happened in Stuttgart) through the security check unnecessary  with the known that connection fligths with minimal change time can be missed.,vie


Vienna is a great airport as long as you are flying on either Austrian Airlines or one of its partner airlines. If you are forced to fly from the old terminal then get ready for a horrible experience. Not enough places to sit or buy food and drinks. Staff is generally unpleasant and the airport building depressing. There are some windows but it's really hard to see any aircraft due to the design of the building.,vie


At the security check  I had a body search and the lady asked me to open my trousers  and she was pulling it down a bit that my underwear could be seen. She did this whole check in front of everybody  especially plenty of men. I felt really humiliated and emberrassed  since everybody was looking at me  furthermore I was boarded a muslim airline and this action showed a huge disrespect. When I asked the lady why did not she do something like this in the preassigned room for all this checks  she told me I have to ask her in advance  if I want her to check me in privately  otherwise it is totally normal to pull someone's trousers down in front of the other passengers. I found this unacceptable and since I am travelling a lot from many other airports  I can tell that such an action is not practised anywhere else in the world than Vienna!!!,vie


Swift security  and great views airside from Terminal 3  with good wifi. However the shops are ridiculously expensive!,vie


In Terminal 1 security check immediately before the gate  thus you should spend some time in a very small space waiting for boarding. Long waiting lines during check in. High prices for local goods at airopt duty free shop (2-3 times as those in city shops),vie


I think VIE arport is the best in Europe and one of the best in the world. Good atmosphere and is easy to find your gate. Wi-Fi is also excellent at VIE and free  I think you get 24hr.,vie


It's not a good thing to board through the old terminal 1.Everythigs looks old compare with the new one.,vie


Terribly confusing airport. Beware leaving security area at unexpected places if you move between terminals. Signposting is insufficient.,vie


The new terminal is a bit of a mess but I was lucky to not have to transfer between the old and the new one,vie


A dismal embarassment of a project. Embezzlement was rife when this was built and it shows. The only reason I travel through here is because I have no better option for the journeys I take.,vie


One of the best airports I've been so far  if not the best. Great service  excellent facilities  good wi-fi connection  everything was just great.,vie


One of the best airports I've been so far  if not the best. Great service  excellent facilities  good wi-fi connection  everything was just great.,vie


The business lounge of Austrian in the Schengen Zone of T3 (F-gates) is surprisigly minimalistic  given that this is the home base of AUA. Better have breakfast elsewhere and don't count on the one single male toilet (!) in the lounge...,vie


Stupid Terminal 3 - the worst terminal I have ever seen. Very little space  a lot of staircases with even more corners.,vie


Vienna airport is really great and efficient. A middle-sized airport located 20 mins from Vienna  and serves also Bratislava. Many parts have undergone improvement works. The check-in is good  you can easily find your airline. The security check is the fastest  that I've ever experienced. The airport is really airy and full of space. Duty free is pretty big and full of good shops...,vie


I love Vienna airport. I put 4 points cause of terrible rude Austrian Airlines airport staff. But the airport is really awesome.,vie


This airport is a labyrinth with many unecessary detours through long corridores and long queues at the security checks. It is painful to transfer here  especially when you don't have much time between flights.,vie


Nice terminal but not many places where you can recharge mobile phones and laptops. However  many places to lay down.,vie


I transferred from Asia to within EU  with EU passport immigration took about 2 minutes  the additional baggage check was a pain thought! There were comfortable seats in the terminal but for the toilets (gates F) you have to climb down and up narrow stairs!!! There are a few handicapped toilets without stairs  but surely not everyone who has luggage or tired can use those. No shelves at the pissoires.,vie


On my return flight SOF-VIE-TXL my luggage did not arrive with me on Berlin Airport. Austrian Airlines left it on VIE together with the luggage of other passenger  who were flying to TXL via VIE. First time that my luggage did not arrive with me! But they delivered next day to my home address.,vie


I flew from WAW to CDG via Vienna (one ticket)  but unfortunately I had to go at the airport in Vienna through security control.,vie


Skylink is a terrible building. Overbudget and continuously revised  it is dark  bleak  and claustrophobic. Food outlets are minimal  shopping is minimal  most toilets are accessed via stairs  the rolling walkways end arbitrarily  the escalators are just slightly too narrow to allow people to pass. Checkin gates are now obsessively the self checkin option...so those former checkin agents are now walking around helping people checkin. A total farce.,vie


Terminal 3 very nice and modern  however mostly very expensive food outlets. Comfy seating through the further part of the terminal.,vie


Amazing airport. Good atmosphere   easy to find your gate . You can check in through a screen which is really handy. Free wifi & lots of restaurants and shops! City Airport train takes you to Vienna in 10 minutes!,vie


in the chek-in was warked only 3 people. all line aproximately80-100 people have to wait long time. waiting time 40-45 min. is written on the walls of Vienna airposts  that this is the best airport staff in Europe-but they are not!!!1,vie


A shambles of planning and execution. Badly laid-out  oppressive  dark  bad and limited choice of food. The old terminal building is much more enjoyable and less claustrophobic. All lavatories are accessible only by stairs. Staff generally unfriendly but some shine out and seem all the better for their rareness.,vie


I was little disappointed from Vienna International Airport. There are just 3 information desks on the whole facility. Depends where you are located  they might be on the other end so you should cross the whole place in order to find the information you are looking for. Toilets were shabby and dirty. If you are a transit passenger and your ticket is not checked-in to the final destination  they don't have transit / transfer desk so you must go outside the arrival and go back inside from the departure hall so that you can catch your next flight. So be sure to have enough transfer time.,vie


I arrived 15 min prior to Boarding time with the train  I was in 10 mins thru security and at my gate (the farest from Security  Schengen T3). The queue at immigration was long. Good airport and friendly staff.,vie


I found the arrivals area to be rather chaotic  we arrived at the same time as an Emirates 777 and there was a significant wait at the passport check and the baggage collection area was very congested.,vie


It was my first time flying  and I totally adore Vienna airport. It looks so modern. I had no problems. Staff is very nice and polite. You can never get bored in this airport. Flight was really good  I just felt that inside the plane there should be more space.,vie


Very nice airport.The connection with the center is very easy with trains.I prefer the S7 train is cheaper than C.A.T and only few minutes slower.In additional the airport has very friendly personel.Many airlines have this airport as hub,vie


Skylink is the worst-designed international hub in Europe. It is cramped  dark  uncomfortable and poorly-designed to a level that would make Satan smile. It was only half-completed due to back-handers and favours  and it shows. Take the train to Bratislava if you can. The Slovaks actually know what they are doing.,vie


Vienna is a small international Airport. There is free WLan is unlimited and basically everywhere available. The sings are good. The rest areas are sufficient and the toilets are clean. A nice little airport. The tower has an very interesting shape.,vie


The refurbished airport is ok. The ways are a bit long and complicated  first up  then down and afterwards up. You have to go through the shopping area  but thats usual in most airports now  so .... The conncection to the city center is perfect. You can use the CAT express which goes in less than 20 minutes to the city. WIFI ist free in the hole Terminal. Thats GREAT !,vie


This airport is just fabulous easy to get to easy to navigate around friendly the only confusing thing is that you go through duty free etc BEFORE you hit security odd but each gate has its own security channel so you then go straight into the departure lounge I loved this airport all others should be as good and efficient as this top airport best I have been in by a long way.,vie


Easy to get in with a direct bus from Czech republic  however long walk from bus stop to the correct terminal. Self-checking works OK (unlike Austrina webpage)  security was a breeze  everything else works correct. I did not try wifi  but I was impressed by nicely organised working seat at every gate at Terminal 3.,vie


New "Skylink" is one big defect of planning. Signs are confusing (eg. showing everywhere Terminal "A" altough it does not even exist)  long corridors  small waiting areas at the gates  dirty toilettes  grumpy staff everywhere.,vie


Vienna airport is a little bit confusing  indications are not clear and if you don't pay attention you can lost yourself. So take this in mind if you travel from/to/through VIE. Communications con the city with train and bus are good  and the airport provides free WIFI  so very useful.,vie


Security was super fast. While there are a lot of shopping options  not much on food.. Airport seems a little dated. A little cramped  not a lot of seating etc. Security was super fast.

The best thing about Vienna Airport is probably the security check in Terminal 3. Lots of lanes and everytime the waiting time is close to zero. WiFi is also excellent at VIE  certainly one of the best in Europe. Easy to access and very fast. Check in-area of Terminal 1 and the "Plaza" were renovated recently. Pier West currently gets modernized. However  the check-in area in T3 could be a bit larger and - depending on your gate - you might have to walk a while to get to the next toilet.,vie


Good shops  nice navigation to gates. Also the check ins are looking good. I like the design of the airport very much. Very good are train station and CAT station too. You can rent a car there on nice place  so you can get by the tunnel from parking to checkins.,vie


long ways from check in to the terminals and back. good connections to public transport. free wifi is great. baggage claim is quick but that's not hard if you have to walk for a long time to reach it.,vie


With the new Terminal  the airport has a modern and comfortable place to start your journey into the world. Free WiFi and if you read the signs  all facilities are easy to find. Also getting off to the Airport via the City Airport Train is quite easy and in a average off 20min done.,vie


on the whole the airport isn't that bad. But when i was there a lot of shops and restaurants were closed because they were under construction - thereof we had to eat in a bad and pretty expensive restaurant,vie


Using VIE for connecting flights is not a good idea. It´s very unclear  safety checks everywhere and changing the planes is really interesting affair. I arrived next to my departure gate  but it took me over ½ hour to get there. For some reason they don´t always use jet bridges even if there is one on the stand. So you can´t just walk to your departure gate. Not advisable to do with tight schedule.,vie


Ugly new part (Austrian / Star Alliance Terminal) ... much too narrow  to many stairs ... The old Terminal is much more open and friendly than the new black terminal called sky-link!,vie


Extra security checks at the gates are real pain in the ass. Otherwise it´s a nice airport with the usual services. Small enough to catch a connecting flight even with a tight changing schedual. If I remember correctly from the last visit  WiFi is also free  which is nice.,vie


Check-in 3 looks good  but there are quite long distances to walk,vie


SKY lounge,vie


Very good airport  I like the cheap parking lot "Mazur"  from where goes a bus to terminals.,vie


Not so bad  very overpriced and poorly laid out. Arrivals area is very nice.,vie


The StarAlliance Terminal looks great. But long long ways to walk.... really not a good concept.,vie


This airport is not user friendly. Long ways  lots of stairs (w/o escalators!!). The dark interior of the " new" terminal already provides a morbide feeling at the very beginning when travelling to Vienna. After such a short time already shabby...,vie


New terminal  free WiFi  nice "Notebook-seats". Very fast security checks.,vie


Viel zu lange Wege !,vie


Badly designed  cramped  dark  walkways are too narrow  and everything is done vertically. Compared to the openness of Brussels  this is a terribly-designed building.,vie


27A,vie


free internet  nice place to seat,vie


Ordinary airport.,vie


Great airport  always a pleasure being home :)),vie


Good airport  made possible for a 35min connection across the terminal  going trough customs ans security.,vie


Adorei o aeroporto  principalmente porque foi aqui que vi um B747 pela primeira vez ao vivo.,vie


they've lost my baggage,vie


Small but nice airport  service is fine. Mobile boarding pass is supported.,vie


not actual austrian,vie


much to long ways,vie

Business lounge was good. Airport transfer was confusing as no signs/info.,vie


I got lost this time.,vie


One of the best european airports...,vie

the rental car counters are ages away from the luggage claim. It feels like walking across the airfield.,vie


No train service as of 11.30pm :(,vie


The new Skylink is very poorly designed. No possibility of transfer between different gates  long walks  bad signs ( ↓ means forward  not downstairs) and ( gates 1-99 does not in fact exists  there is a lot less gates than that). Worst airport ever!,vie


helpful airport officials  nice and sincere crew  it was really worth it to fly through this airport.,gyd


Weak transfer experience. Rude imigration officers  misleading info in transfer desk  rude security. I will not transfer in Baku again!,gyd


Transfer desk employees gave bad informations: 1. That Ii need paper boarding pass to enter LH flight (not true) 2. I will not enter lounge with electronic boarding pass ( also not true) So made me to wait in transit zone till 3 hrs before flight  then took my passport and went to public zone to checkin to print boarding passes. Weak transfer experience. Than when sitting on bench in transit zone some imigration officer came and said I cannot sit here. Asked why? Because thay see me in CCTV.. what a rude behavouir. Never ever transit ib Baku  new building.. but personel stayed in comunism.,gyd


Incredibly modern and spacious airport with many facilities. Definitely first class and reminds me somewhat of Istanbul  but smaller. Would give it six stars if I could.,gyd


Queues for immigration and visa check is too long  took over 1 hour. Transport links to the city are great. Wi-Fi was slow in the immigration area.,gyd


No airport express runs between 11pm-7am  although the official airport website has the schedule with hourly departures throughout the night. Rather crowded passport control (only 3 counters)  virtually all airport staff assumes you understand Russian and does not speak either English or Turkish.,gyd

Why crew of International airport in Baku cant communicate with passengers in english??? Its ridiculous...,gyd


Very good  modern airport here in Baku. i think a lot of its customers enjoy it. Lots of food restaurants and lots of other good stuff. Very friendly  helpful staff. Fast check-in. Good wifi.,gyd


This rate is concerning to T2 of G. Aliev airpot which is much more worse than T1 which is wonderful.,gyd


Beautiful airport. Great location  just 20 mins to Baku downtown. Unlimited free Wi-Fi  tasty and not so expensive restaurants.,gyd


New airport  but managed by idiots and idiotic staff. Insufficient information boards  CORRUPTION and scammers !!!! There is no public taxi service !!! When you exit the airport  a chaotic crowd of taxi drivers will pounce on you. And if you are a foreigner you will be taken to the city center for an inflated price. This is not an airport  it's an Eastern Bazaar!,gyd


Аэропорт новый  но очень мало розеток ночью. С утра ставят чарджер  видимо  на ночь убирают,gyd


Bus stop is situated too far from terminal  there are no signs how to get there. Taxi drivers are insistant but one can get to the downtown by very cheap public transport.,gyd


There was no information about our flight on monitors. When I asked from personal she said "because of that this AZAL flight  information about it is not shown on the monitor". Miracles Miracles  there is no word to say...,gyd

The airport is clean and spacious. There are major food and retail services  car rentals and duty free shop.,bah


Quick and smooth check-in and security check. Great terminal facilities and WiFi working even on the apron. Wow!,bah


Excellent new airport  not crowded  good facility  helpful and friendly ground staff  short walks  easy orientation  security with newest technology with no 100ml cap,bah


Travelled to Bahrain Airport for a transit. The new terminal is very nice: easy  fast  clean and with numerous shops. To be recommanded!,bah


The old airport is coming to it's end of life. Construction of a new terminal is ongoing. Facilities are outdated  but everything is quick.,bah


Tables in pearl lounge filthy. Definitely not covid friendly. Check in staff unhelpful and rude - declared multiple times that I had the wrong visa despite it being stamped in my passport. Immigration staff even ruder - ‘your passport is too full  you need to keep it cleaner’ when he couldn’t find my entry stamp. Security staff watched me remove laptop and electronics  then told me no need and to repack immediately. They’d watched me take a few minutes to do this and didn’t think to stop me. Would not fly back via here again through choice. Both arrival and departure experiences unnecessarily stressful with rude staff.,bah


Clean airport  but poorly signposted for taxis ans rude immigration staff - he said card payment was fine  but did not tell me debit card would not work for visa payment. When he tried it twice he very loudly announced that ‘I had no money’. When I used a different card he then told me that debit card wouldn’t work and only credit card  but only after both embarrassing me and making me stress that my card was not working. Not acceptable.,bah


Easy to go through  efficient process  plenty of seating and especially the lounge was very nice! Looking forward to the new airport.,bah


Chaos; airplane ready for boarding  people waiting in a queue in front of a gate  just the boarding staff missing...,bah


the airport is small and needs a lot of renovation and it need to be bigger as there are a lot of transit passengers laying down on the chairs . and the duty free is small compared to other airports in the area . and the smoking rooms are always crowded and the place near them are very smelly,bah


The best airport I've ever seen. Excellent design  no stress  good duty free  bar.... I love it. It's not a big terminal but it's,bah


One Of The Finest Airport in the world.. :) Well maintained.. Easy Transits  Lovely Terminal  Stress Free Ambience. Best Duty Free in Middle East. Lovely Airport. Fast WiFi Connectivity  throughout the airport. Gulf Air' s Golden Falcon Lounge ..... Lovely one.,bah


Bahrain is a simple airport which makes for a refreshing change from the overly large airports around the Middle East. I flew business which means a separate checkin area to avoid queues and also a separate immigration and security control which also means no queues. It's nice to fly from an airport with no long walks...,bah


Good free wi-fi at the airport  free phone chargers. Except for that  a very very average airport. The directions to the gates are messy and the A/C is turned way too low  it was freezing cold. The shops are horrible and you'd better hope not to spend here more than a few hours.,bah


Great airport for short time connection timings. connecting flight security check staff was probably one the most rude staff i have ever seen in my entire journey around the globe. Harassing treatment from member of security staff. overall this is one of the great airport.,bah


TRANSIT,bah


Fastest connecting flight I've ever done. 13 minutes from leaving the 1st flight to being in my seat on the second. It really is the fastes connecting airport in the middle east.,bah


=),bah


Stayed over 2 hours in the Golden Falcon lounge.,bah


this airport was small with just 1 bar  we flew in at rushhour  and there were just 7 planes  1 ba 767-300er  the rest gulf air,bah


that time it was a smalle airport whit nothing to do,bah


Из минусов: - Добираться на частных маршрутках  билет надо заранее купить на автовокзале (в интернете нельзя). - Код Wi-Fi попросту не приходил. В остальном - отличный аэропорт. У Белавии стоят терминалы саморегистрации  было очень удобно  т.к. летел Белавией.,msq


Был хороший выход на посадку  однако не очень понятно куда идти при транзитном рейсе,msq


как в 90-х и надо было заново досмотр и паспортный контроль проходить,msq


Small airport and very slow Passport/border control officers. They always find something to complain about upon entering Minsk  they are rude and very slow. Worst airport i ever been to.,msq


Well  this is very cool airport. It is small  but that is not problem. The only negative is internet  not very good,msq


I can recommend the official airport transfer service - details at https://airport.by/en/tourism/transfer,msq


Decent airport  undergoing improvements. No train service  but cheap bus and taxi. Immigration not very fast  but the queue is quite short - airport is not very busy.,msq


The security check was so slow that I forgot I had been told to take out my laptop!!! Nobody warned me when I left without it. I only realized when I was about to take the bus to the plane. Kudos to the staff who helped me get it back and of course to Belavia for waiting and sending an extra bus for me (wouldn't it be more efficient to have the business class minibus wait for me?),msq


Not recommended for transfer. For some  unknown and ununderstandable reason  passengers have to wait on an empty transit counter in a uncosy and warm hall after leaving a plane. After 20 Minutes  a single staff had to look at passports and bording passes to be let to the connecting flights gate. Avoid Minsk Airport at all costs!,msq


Minsk international is a convenient airport and not very busy. Always fast check-in and fast security/passport control. -- To get to the city use official airport taxi (about 15 usd).,msq


Quit far from the city  but buses go from the Central bus station quite often for 2-3 euro. Here is you will find a real duty free shop. Very cheap local traditional alcohol.,msq


Very big and comfortable airport. Very good for transit flights  have a lot af facilities to charge phone. But Wi-Fi works until you leave the airport. Once you come back  it doesn't work.,msq


Too dark. Almost no glass  but grey stone. To get to gates you need to pass through multiple duty-free shops. To get to transit lounge you need to follow business-lounge directin  and finally there is Wi-fi (which requires you to receive SMS code first),msq


Wi-Fi нет  чтобы войти  нужно получить пароль  но когда копируешь пароль из смс  окно куда его вводить исчезает. Кароче логин и пароль нужно запоминать или записывать сначала  только потом вводить. Не осилил этот бред,msq


I stayed at the airport hotel from around 1am to 7am. Satisfied. Unfortunately no wifi in the area  you need to go to a different floor. (there's free wifi at Prime café),msq


не пустили в бизнес-зал по Priority Pass. Персонал вообще не в курсе  как это работает. Потом стали тупить и говорить  что не работает терминал для соединения с интернетом и т.д. Глупость редчайшая.,msq


Грубые и нахальные сотрудники государственной службы безопасности и полиции аэропорта  персонал хамит. В туалетах нет горячей воды. Молодежь  работающая в авиакомпаниях и на досмотре наоборот - очень вежливая и обходительная.,msq


Airport is small  doesn`t have free wi-fi. To get to the airport you can by bus (1 hour from the centre of the city)  by train+bus 500m (1 hour)  ticket price near 1 5 USD. Ticket for bus you can buy in automat or ask driver of the bus. Taxi propose 30-50 USD.,msq


Очень понравился данный аэропорт. Рейсы практически не задерживают. Питание на борту приличное. Прекрасный экипаж. Спасибо за путешествие по небу :),msq


После реставрации стал очень красивым и удобным. Везде расставлены знаки  по сравнению с тем  что был до реставрации  где их было не найти. Достаточно просторный  люде,msq


The spotting-bar "Polyot" is closed till September. If you like aviation-themed souvenirs  check out magnets with pictures of the airport. And terminal for non-international flights is much worse than the international one.,msq


Сложно представить  однако в международном аэропорту МИНСК платный WI-FI Изобретатели  однако! Злектричка до порта не доходит  требуется пересадка в автобус. Бесплатно на автомобиле встретить пассажиров не возможно  цены за стоянку чудовищные. Аэропрорт большой  однако пустой  никто сюда не летает.,msq


After reconstruction works looks much nicer. It was improving check-in and a lounge zone. Finally Duarte free shops getting better. Enough space for wait flight. Just need improve customer service and wifi should be free even for 15-30 min.,msq


Double security check for all international departures. Wifi is payable only. Some areas in the terminal is under construction  so 3rd flour transit area is in dust. Waiting zones near the gates is too small. Most of information tables are switched off in "sterile" zone.,msq


Big and convenient terminal. After partitial reconstruction works it became modern international airport. It has spotting bar now! That`s good.Terminal seemed to me slightly empty inspite of its size largeness. Seemed hard finding check-in sectors  but that is only my humble opinion :),msq


После реконструкции аэропорт преображается просто на глазах. Стало приятно возвращаться домой. Осталось совсем чуть-чуть - объяснить работникам (а главное руководству) значение слова сервис. И все наладится. Без этого никуда. Особенно если они надеются привлекать транзитных пассажиров...,msq


During a 5 hours transit all shops were closed except of a bar. No entertainment and the waiting are was way to insufficient. And the airport staff need to have some lessons English.,msq


It's too cold,msq


Рейсы аэрофлота теперь выполняются в гейте №3,msq


MSQ may look large from outside but inside area its small and poorly organized  located too far from Minsk  waiting area is insufficient  no entertainment. From the positive aspects - low prices are appreciated and low traffic means no crowds,msq


Pozhalui odin iz samih hudshih aeroportov v Evrope edinstvennoe prijatnoe-eto malo reisov sootvetstvenno i ludei.,msq


Currency exchange is closed (16:40 at Friday!)  all 3 ATMs are out of service  no lifts  just 1 escalator  but out of service and so narrow  that it is impossible to take it with any laggage,msq


Достаточно комфортный аэропорт.Недавно открыли в зоне вылета что-то похожее на Duty Free.Большой и требует инвестиций,msq


Airport without car is only reachable by bus from closest train station and does not offer much to do  so be aware to not arrive well ahead of time. Wifi is strong  security and checkin quite quickly. Boarding may be slow if another aircraft is already boarding.,anr


Fantastic small airport. Check-In and Security cleared within minutes. Gate 1 offered good views across the airfield  but limited seating  due to some form of construction work taking place. Public transport access to the airport seems rather limited though  with either a 10-15min walk from Mortsel Station  or a taxi ride from Antwerp City.,anr


Great little airport  very fast. Fokker 50heaven ;) Parking is still free but this will change soon with the expansion of flights going on. The home carrier VLM is a fantastic airline as well! Premium service for a low cost price !,anr


As we were flying with a private plane from this airport  the facilities were of course ecellent. No time waiting  private check-in and security check  great lounge... When you're flying on a regular flight  the aiport is very convenient as well. Small  but fast. It's mainly a business airport so good food and WiFi  but less shops.,anr


Well  it's a really small airport with bad connections to the city... Atleast the customs were fast and friendly  also the walking from my plane (ATR72) to the terminal was kinda nice  ah well  that's because I was surrounded by maybe 5 fokker 50's! XD But  from what I saw  it's just another small airport  nothing special.,anr


This is a great little airport and if you have the time they have a super aircraft museum right next door.,anr


The only one airport I was with toilets for money only... It is kind a joke... really bad experience!,crl


It is a joke that you have to pay for the toilet on the airport. I have never experienced something like that crazy idea!,crl


This smaller  regional  airport has undergone significant improvements since its last construction work in 2022. It does not provide a drop and go zone  requiring passengers to utilize the main parking area and pay a fee of 3€ for entry and exit  which could be considered relatively expensive. The parking facilities were quite full during my visit. Despite being crowded  the security procedures were executed swiftly and efficiently. The airport's installations were well-maintained and clean  leaving no room for complaints in that department.,crl


The price of the official car parks has been raised again this month (July 2023). Where I used to pay 27 € I now have to pay 35 € : a 25 % raise !,crl


Even toilettes (upon arrival) are paid! Despite each passenger pays airport fees within the ticket price. outrageous,crl


Very unsexy Airport. Chaotig facilities and parking situation. Food court available but extremely narrow and crowded. Much to less seats at the gates. Leaving the flight within rain is a mess  complete foodway hasnt a roof. Signs for parking quite rare. Even if booked a parking f.e. at P2 you have to circle and circle to find a parking lot or wait until someone leaves. Trashy.,crl


A bus stop in the middle of nowhere has more to offer than this excuse of an airport. I guess there must be worse  but for a European airport  this is scraping the bottom.,crl


An airport that does not pretend to be something it is not. Despite its small size immigration was fast and baggage reclaim was also swift. Getting to Brussels is easy enough  however  the bus can get busy and you may need to wait for the next one.,crl


Well its typical ryanair territory  like 40 min away from the city  other than that its well equipped clean and fresh  with friendly staff,crl


It’s a really good airport  check in was easy to find and quick to get through as well as security and they had a good few restaurants and a big duty free. They had a lovely little terrace with a bar  which would be lovely in summer!,crl


Great little airport  handles a handful of flights a day and has a relatively busy terminal  which it can handle.,crl


It took very  very long for the bagage belt to start moving. The first people collected their bagage 10 minutes after they arrived at the belt. After the bagage claim it was really strait forward as with all journeys within the EU.,crl


Not a too long walk and quick check-in and security. Enough seating in the gate area and a few shops for food and leisure items.,crl


A long walk  too busy check-in area and very limited seating in the gate area. The COVID-19 check also took very long.,crl


BRUSSELS SOUTH CHARLEROI AIRPORT IS A PRETTY EFFICIENT LOW-COST AIRPORT. HOWEVER  GETTING TO THE AIRPORT FROM CHARLEROI-SUD TRAIN STATION IS VERY PAINFUL. TEC'S BUSES BRINGS VERY POOR SERVICES (BUS THAT DOES NOT COME AND/OR SEVERAL TEMPORARY STATION AROUND THE AIRPORT NOT DISPLAYED AND CHANGING OFTEN). I DID NOT TRIED FLIBCO BUSES THAT SEEMS TO BRING BETTER SERVICES DIRECTLY FROM ZUID STATION IN BRUSSELS AND OTHER CITY CENTER IN BELGIUM. OBVIOUSLY THESE SERVICES ARE OFFERED AT A HIGHER COST.,crl


The airport is somewhat hard to find. Many roadsigns leading to the airport are actually wrong. Use a GPS or Google Maps  don't follow the road signs. Friendliness of staff is horrible. Airport staff (especially security  but also some PSA's) are really unfriendly. Not just a bit  but a lot. Like there is an internal competition going on who can be the unfriendliest. I've noticed this on previous occasions  but thought I was unlucky with the persons working on that day. This is the third time I fly from this airport and I was really impressed by how unfriendly a person can be. Mainly for this reason I can absolutely not recommend Charleroi Airport.,crl


Nice airport with limited things to do in it as it is small. WiFi is not great as you have to pay for it so I did not use it at all.,crl


Brussels Charleroi is a small compact airport only marked down for me as it is a fair way from Brussels Central (47kms)  which means you really need to factor that in for early departures. Also since the attack at the main Brussels Airport  security means nobody pulls up out front of the terminal  you are dropped some way off then walk through a tent like structure as an initial security barrier normally full of heavily armed security personnel  then you walk across to the terminal doors over the old road that has long since been blocked off. Has good amenities and not bad  just let down by the access and distance for me.,crl


We bought train tickets to Brussels after landing near midnight at the ticket vending machine only to know that the trains stop commuting after 22:30. Though there is a bus of the same price and we get to the city with no problem  we were not able to easily refund those train tickets.,crl


Very little space  not enough seating area  narrow halls. slow wi-fi and not that good public trasport to town. Tickets can be purchased only with card or coins! Not bills accepted  so if you travel further there is no way that you would have 30euro in coins! This is sick.,crl


Terminal 2 has only one bar/cafeteria. Too small for 3 gates (around 600 people in  at the same time).,crl


Way too long at the security check  we almost missed our flight due to the queue. Otherwise it's basic low cost airport  quite operational.,crl


Super dirty in every single spot (even the restaurant part). A huge amount of people - totally not prepared for the number of passengers. One of the worst airports I've had a chance to use. For plus - they finally made free wi-fi access. Generally - not recommending.,crl


Immigration was at its worst this evening. Some 200 pax packed in a low-ceilinged room  hot  stuffy  with only two immigration officers on duty (later  they woke up two more). But it took me a good 20 minutes to get through. Charleroi is no more the smart and friendly airport when you could go in or out in a few minutes ... its huge success has changed all that for the worst.,crl


Overcrowded  especially in the rush hours  dirty lounges and often dirty bathrooms  ridiculously overpriced Internet connection (still!)  overpriced food and water... A total mess...,crl


Charleroi is victim of its success : always crowded  queues at the security check  not a lot of breathing space anywhere !,crl


Charleroi  8 millions of passengers per year  but the terminal is not designed for this capacity. Getting to the airport is not bad  but there is no possibility to get to the airport without paying entrance fees. The bus costs 6€  parking form 0 to 10 minutes costs 50 cents  no way out to the bus which stops a street further and costs 3€. Security terrible  they throw with your belongings  don't speak english  dutch  only french or arabic. When sth falls on the ground they say "it's not me"  it could be your computer  phone  doesn't matter  they don't care about anything. No free wifi  15 minutes around 2€ so for nowadays it very expensive. Drinks beginning from 3€ and up  food from 5€. Terrible  that is what I can say and it's not particularly this one time  I have flown from this airport like 100 times and every time even worse.,crl


A small and crowded airport but it manages to get all the passengers from a to b in a decent manner. Getting to the airport is only acceptable by car or a busride from charleroi which takes 30 minutes. They are expanding the airport so hopefully the future will bring more terminal facilities.,crl


One of the worst airports in Europe right now  overcrowded  often dirty  and with an expensive Internet connection (yes  in 2016 we still need to pay for Internet in the center of Europe).,crl


C'est un aéroport low-cost  base de Ryanair. Ne pas s'attendre à du grand luxe. Mais le dimensionnement pourrait être revu pour le contrôle sécurité  pour les halls souvent noirs de monde. Le parking est très cher  ils doivent se rattraper là-dessus,crl


It was fucking fuck There was NO transport to get to the Charleroi-city Also there was too less space for passengers And fucking non-free wifi,crl


The security was the worst experience  very impolite staff  unhelpful as they were for a family of six trying to navigate through customs. The food was the most overpriced I've ever seen  the water could be termed as price-gouging.,crl


Late night arrival  no food available. Shuttle service was ready to take us to the nearby hotel. Pretty deserted and not altogether well-marked.,crl


Well  in one of the reviews someone wrote "It was fucking fuck". I prefer not to use such language  but I do agree. The airport itself is actually pretty ok - on arrival I got out of the airport quickly  and on the way back I came 15 minutes before departure and still made the flight (including security check  border control and all of that stuff). But the fact I had to pay almost 100€ for 2 people for a return bus ticket to Brussels  by a very average bus that felt like it was going 60 km/h  makes me never want to fly to this airport again. Never.,crl


Charleroi was a small airport and everything for claiming our luggage to checkin in upon arrival for our flight back was quick  smooth and easy. The staff was friendly and my overall impression of the airport was efficient  smooth and clean.,crl


Incredibly inconvenient for overnight transfers. I coyuldn't even but water  as all cafes are closed  and machines accept coins only.,crl


The facilities of CRL are ok  but the problem is that the amount of travellers is growing at a crazy rate. The result is a terminal that feels cramped and crowded all the time. Especially arriving in the late evening is a horrible experience  as navigating the enormous amounts of people takes quite some effort. Plus the lack of free wifi is appaling in a Western European airport. Transport options are ok as there are frequent and affordable shuttle buses to Brussels South train station. No free wifi here  either  though.,crl


Very expensive and overcrowded airport  far away from the city with expensive bus connection having a monopoly on the route. There is no free wifi. I hate Charleroi airport from my very heart and soul!,crl


If you buy your ticket in advance at flibco.com  you can get to Lille from the airport for €5. WiFi is to be payed. At the restaurant 1 bottle of water (0.5l) costs €3.4  at the newspaper shop it costs €2.,crl


Charleroi is a small airport caring mainly for LCC (Ryanair has one of its main base at CRL Wizzair connects it with destinations in Eastern Europe). It's cheerful  and pleasant  but it can be crowded at times;,crl


The airport is located about an hour of distance from Brussels  however  the capital is easily accessible by a large amount of buses. Basically  the airport facilities are specious and well-kept. Unfortunately  there's NO free Wi-Fi available at the airport  as well as the amount of energy sockets is limited.,crl


The airport is actually quite far from Brussels. The transport connections are awful. Still there is no need to complain because the plane tickets are so cheap ! The airport is known for receiving illegal regional funding (according to EU) so let's profit. Quite practical to go and spend its money under the sun (because let's face it Belgium is not a sunny place ;-),crl


I flew to Charleroi for 6 hours from Budapest.I dont have any problem with airport but city center and train connection is very tragic.Everybody waited 45 minutes for bus on outside and weather is very cold too.I will be in city center later 2 hours from Charleroi.I never fly this airport for Brussels,crl


The most horrible airport I have ever seen. Slow and bad Xray control. There was no free wifi but an expensive one (15 mins- 2 euro). Boarding at the gate for Trapani was unfair because a lot of people got into the priority line without having a priority ticket. Furthermore  they didn't even check what was written on that paper. I don't reccomend to anybody that airport and wish the flight assistants were awaken.,crl


Der ordentliche Bereich ist lächerlich klein. Nach der Sicherheitskontrolle wird es angenehmer und etwas ruhiger. Schöner Blick durch große Glasscheiben auf das Vorfeld. Für Flüge außerhalb der EU gibt es einen kleinen Duty Free Shop.,crl


Very small and busy airport. Very long queues to sercurity check but sercuritty crew were OK. NO free Wi-Fi at all! Some shops on terminal but nothing special. Typical low-fares airlines airport. Overall 4/5 ;),crl


You don't have to be there really much in advance. One hour before flight departure is more than enough. The airport itself is tiny and there are not many shops. There is Wi-Fi but you have to pay a tremendous amount of money for it.,crl


Quite good airport  a lot of possibilities to travel to Luxembourg/ France/ Belgium using cheap buses outside the terminal. Wi-Fi isn't free  stores are great. You can easily charge your phone using power sockets.,crl


Small  but very useful airport. Easy to catch from Brussels and all Belgium by train or by bus. Nice restaurants and good foods  beers. Very clean  and open 24 hours. You can see the planes from the terminal building. Wifi isn't free  very expensive  without an account you can only see the airport website.,crl


Charleroi Brussels South is a fine airport  by regional airports standards. There are a few shops for goodies  food and drinks  but it's nothing impressive. Things usually go quicker than in bigger airports. When we arrived back here from our trip  we did not have to wait for our luggage at all. It's also a nice looking airport. What makes it feel a little cheap though  is the fact that you have to walk outside to board your plane. Also  wifi is not free.,crl


A nice low-cost airport  easy and convenient; nice people  too.,crl


15 euro cost taxi/bus for one person to the Brussels. Taxi drivers are catching every single person who is leaving the airport.,crl


Good airport - Lots of Duty free for purchases - But the control was disorganized - For planespotters  you have good places to see the airplanes,crl


Worst airport in Europe. No space for security check  food is crap  no place to sit at the gates  too crowded even outside holliday season. When arriving there is a parking is terrible and blocked constantly.,crl


Small  crowded  and dirty. Behind Bucharest Baneasa  the worst airport I've ever flown to/from.,crl


Small but well organized airport.,crl


Great and efficient airport !,crl


Small and crowded,crl


very good,crl


nie za duże  wszystko sprawnie tylko czemu tak wcześnie? Po za tym miło i sprawnie,crl


The Ryanair Dreamliner was there!!!,crl


Almost no place to seat.,crl


no free wi-fi,crl


Long queues to security control  beacuse of only 2 checkpoints open and a lot of ads saying you can pay 4€ for less crappy security check. Almost 20 minutes spend on crowded stairs before finally boarding the plane.,crl


small but got a few good spot to sleep :D slept there for 3nights in a row :D,crl


Horrible airport  poor service,crl


Horrible accessibility from anywhere besides Charleroi itself.,crl


brussels south is an good airport  the only bad thing is the chekpoint before you get to the gates where they check your handluggage,crl


Very good low cost airport  but very small and on rush hours very busy. Strict rules. Clean and not croudy. Few shops but good shops. You can reach Brussels only with a shuttle bus because it's quite far.,crl


This airport exceeded my expectations for such a small airport. It's modern and clean  and not too busy. However  since it's such a small airport there barely are shops or restaurants.,crl


It's a cheap airport. Far away from Brussels and 15 min from Charleroi. Basic facilities  but clean and good info.,crl


Disaster. Dirty bathrooms  staff with personality issues (excepting the security staff which is quite professional and correct)  expensive (10 EUR for a blackened burger with a card board bun). Food court out of stock after 7PM.,crl


Good airport  friendly staff but it's far from Brussels: with train 60 min and a return ticket is 10 Euro.,crl


(-) est devenu petit... alors qu'il vient d'être construit (-) parking infernal (+) passage de douane par contre = le plus aimables et les plus gentils de tous les aéroports que j'ai utilisé (un bon paquet!),crl


Not bad  just far from Brussels if your flight is at 6:50 a.m. because it is difficult to have a bus so early.,crl


Too slow the operation of security check - long queue - I miss the Ryanair priority feature,crl


Very bad airport  Chaotic and parking is a compleet drama!,crl


Worst airport ever !,crl


the friendly airport,crl


if you buy ticket to Brussel u expect to come to Brussel. But Charleroi is actually 60km outside of Brussel!!!,crl


it's so far from the city centre...,crl


I don't like CRL,crl


Getting to the airport was fine. Check-in was slow and painful to experience  although it was made up to by the quick security checks. Terminal Facilities weren't the best  the same with food services. Paid 10 euros for a roll and also paid 5 euro for a 750ml bottle of water. There wasn't much places to lounge apart from the area where the food stalls were.,bru


Encountered a very rude immigration agent due to my UK passport. The routing for UK passport holders is very confusing and not clear when connecting through this airport,bru


Quite a few destinations considering this is a pretty small airport! Not located in Brussels but Flanders. Easy to get to!,bru


AWFUL immigrations/customs process. NEVER EVER will I transfer through Brussels. I’ve never seen so many passengers miss their flights due to their inability to process in an organized and timely manner.,bru


Baggage drop opens very late  not too much time to spend in the lounge. Priority queue for the security check ends up in the same line as the non-priority queue  which is rather confusing. The tax free shopping prices are not very competitive here.,bru


Brussels Airport stands out as a prime example of a well-equipped and comfortable airport  offering an array of shops and services that cater to a diverse range of needs and preferences. The terminal's layout and amenities are designed to provide a pleasant experience for travelers. The array of retail outlets and service points is impressive  ensuring that passengers have access to everything they might need before their flight. From last-minute gifts to travel essentials  the shopping experience at Brussels Airport is both convenient and enjoyable. However  one area where the airport could improve is in its provision of VIP lounges  especially those accessible through the LoungeKey program. While the existing lounges offer a degree of comfort and exclusivity  the limited options for LoungeKey members mean that many travelers are unable to take advantage of this facility. The addition of more VIP lounges compatible with LoungeKey would significantly enhance the overall experience for frequent travelers and those looking for an extra layer of comfort and service. In summary  Brussels Airport excels in terms of its shopping and general services  providing a comfortable and efficient environment for travelers. However  the expansion of VIP lounge offerings  particularly for LoungeKey members  would be a welcome improvement  elevating the airport's status as a top-tier travel hub.,bru


Well this was hellish getting here. Got off one stop too early on the train heading there and had to wait for an Uber to take me to the airport. Run like hell then go through the tedium of paying for extra kilos and the security process.,bru


Smooth transfer. Changing terminals was easy  but tedious. Not much else to say. Good selection of shops.,bru


I’m going to cut some slack to Brussels Airport as strikes happen very often. However due to strikes by AviaPartner that was not predicted  my two baggage’s were left at Brussels Airport for three days before I reclaimed them in Cairo. We were left in the gateway for ten minutes straight until an official came and told us no baggage will be put on our flight. My check in person notified me about the strike so we knew beforehand.,bru


Çoğu şey iyi ama hiç sevmiyorum neden mi? PASAPORT VE CHECK İN SIRASINDA 4 SAAT AYAKTA BEKLEDİM LAN BU NE,bru


Late arrival and only 45 minutes for transfer. Requested express pass which really helped the Schengen passport control. Last to board our US-bound flight,bru


the loft is awesome. never been to a better lounge. i recommend the massage chairs. Immigrations took years. there were trains to BRU that we took both to the city and back to the airport. they were good and the fast track was really fast,bru


Getting to the airport by train is easy (but more expensive than other EU Cities). Security was kind of slow for the size of the airport  but the staff were very friendly. Good choice of seating available throughout the airport.,bru


the worst train service I have ever used. In the airport I got scammed and they gave me expired food. Getting to the airport and back by train is a huge inconvenience.,bru


Better than the Nice Airport. More organized and more staff spoke English. The airport also was easy to navigate through.,bru


I love this airport. The view to see differents planes from the airport is excellent. Terminals are nice also!,bru


I came in the train only to find massive gates with no way around just to get into the terminal. They didn't recognise my ov ticket because I came with the netherlands train and it is just unnaceptable that they have pay gates just to get into the airport! Never flying out of here again unless its the only option,bru


Un grand duty free mis en place récemment. Le parking est un peu vieillissant et l’offre de restauration est limitée,bru


Brussel's airport is extremely well equipped. It has a lot of shops and restaurants in the terminal. The staff is also really nice and helpful. Underneath the airport you can find a train station that can take you to any city you'd like.,bru


Literally one of the best airports I have ever been. It's quite small compared to the big Europe's or Middle East's but has a big airport's structure and inertia. Big windows with beautiful view on the apron,bru


The parking was quick and easy. Over all nice airport. The check-in was quick and very straight forward. The security check was also very fast.,bru


Only 15 check-in desks were open on one of the busiest days of the year. Queuing took over 2 5 hours resulting in a rushed  unfriendly service and delayed flights.,bru


Due to the attack in Brussels the airport building was broken  so we had to check in in a tent and we had to go to the gate by taking the stairs to the gate area.,bru


Due to Covid crisis  the airport facilities and foods corner where closed. For the rest everything ok.,bru


Gute Anbindung vom Airport  allerdings nicht ganz günstig. Wartezeit noch in Ordnung beim Security Check  es hätten aber ruhig zwei Spuren mehr offen sein dürfen.,bru


Sehr hilfsbereiter Mitarbeiter bei der Bahn (sogar auf Deutsch). Gepäck kam sofort  als wir in diesen Bereich gelangten.,bru


Quite a good airport  but always hectic. The lounge is very good but can sometimes be packed to the rafters. I frequently have experienced luggage damage or delay when travelling through BRU which is irritating.,bru


Scandalous long wait for luggage. More than 40 minutes already after gate arrival. Totally unacceptable.,bru


Security personnel was on strike. Happens often and makes the whole experience extremely unpredictable and difficult for planning.,bru


At baggage drop was asked to repeatedly pay for seat choice. Very slow security this time  queing for 15 min for "suspicious" luggage.,bru


They seem to be stricter than most of the European airports (I guess after the attacks) - my laptop was constantly buzzing  haha. Generally though it wasn't bad. Plus for good free wi-fi.,bru


Upon arrival there was a long line at Passport control. This was at 0900  a peak time for international arrivals. There were no more than 2-3 custom agents working the non-EU line resulting in a 30 wait to get thru Passport control on a Monday morning. And there were at least 3 booths that could have been stàffed.,bru


Pick up area is pretty far from the building. Pretty boring aisle to arrive in from outside Europe. Wait for luggage is long  way above average to other airports.,bru


Lots of strikes disturbing fluid operation. This time it took 10 minute to get the gate connected and the luggage took half an hour to get on the belt. Well  one bag is there in half an hour. The rest is still not there  40 minutes after the plane made it to the gate. Getting one bag on the belt keeps their statistics great  I guess.,bru


Nice airport to fly to and from  well connected with the city center and the rest of Belgium  as well. I've experienced some problems with baggage claim  with high waiting times and luggage delivered in the wrong belt.,bru


Very convenient airport. Easy to get by public transport (lots of train and bus)  very straightforward and easy to get around. Good choice of Belgian food,bru


Un aéroport agréable et moderne. Nombreux magasins  cafés et prises courant. Un de mes préférés.,bru


Busy season at the time of writing so the queue to get to the passport check was long. On the way back after landing at around 22:45  all of the self-check passport gates were closed which is annoying and slows down the processing of arrivals. More often than not  these self-check machines are closed which is pretty disappointing. Otherwise  a normal  uneventful experience.,bru


Easy airport  smooth security check  nice persons  good offer ond food & drinks. Toilets could have been cleaner,bru


The simple lay-out makes the airport very easy to get around. Rather spacious with lots of shops (chocolate  obviously)  and an excellent Brussels Airlines Lounge (nominated as one of the best in Europe  probably it won't win  but the nomination is certainly deserved; excellent fresh food  nice design). Though the airport is expanding it's parking options  car traffic in and around Brussels Airport should be avoided. Traffic jams on Brussels ring are becoming permanent and can even happen at night. There are 6 trains an hour to Brussels City center  in addition to trains to Antwerp City center  and Brussels EU quarter. Plus  the buses to Brussels EU quarter of STIB (Brussels public transport) and to the suburbs of De Lijn (Local public transport). I still don't understand why so many people keep taking the car  while public transport is so well developed.,bru


The security check at the Schengen border control was very slow and only one line was in use even though there were long queues! Quite unorganized action!,bru


Very nice airport  easily accessible by Public Transport. Brussels Airlines lounge has recently been nominated as one of the best lounges in Europe  I don't disagree with the nomination at all (good food  good drink selection  nice views). Getting around airport is very easy,bru


Worse airport ever. Absurde queue at the passport control  absirde procedure at the security checks. Pregnant women have not been allowed to skip the queue. Disgusting.,bru


BRU bus for some reason was not electric this time  and on the way to terminal arrivals entrance made a tour around whole the terminal  including the far ends of both piers 9of caourse - time consuming),bru


A great airport! When you dont have a bag to check in it's the easiest airport I've been to. The new connector is amazing and great for relaxing. Altough the drink prices were a little high  which is to be expected after security  the small relaxing area which has a great view of the tarmac is a great place to stay when you have some time to kill!,bru


You have to wait a lot of time for the baggage  and the distances in the airport from arrival gates are enormous.,bru


Very easy to reach by public transport (Bus or train are much more convenient than cars in Brussels) The airport is the right size (not too big  not too small) and very easy to find your way around Brussels Lounge in Pier A I find one of the better ones in the EU,bru


Baggage claim and getting through immigration/customs went very quick and smoothly. Modern  clean and welcoming airport.,bru


Diamond lounge is simply dirty. Seats are disguisting. Italian restaurant serving pizza is terrible. For over 18 euro I got burned pizza.,bru


The airline neglected to load the luggage of about 100 passengers with no explanation. The result was anger  chaos  and disappointment are the airport in Accra,bru


Information abaout exact check-in/baggage drop-off desk shall be given in advance. Otherwise people are crowding "somwhere here" making difficult passing-by and finally the line is chaotic.,bru


Big queue at the passport check. Only 2 stands active. We waited about 25 minutes to pass. Good terminal facilites.,bru


My flight decked at the far end of Pier A :it's a good 20 minutes (by foot) before reaching the arrival hall - and  around 11.30 pm  absolutely everything is closed : no shop  no restaurant  no café  nothing.,bru


Amazing terminal A here at BRU  really big  nice  clean and modern. Had a very smooth and enjoyable transfer to my next flight home to Prague.,bru


The airport has a single huge terminal  so that long walks are guaranteed. On arrival  I found a member of the cleaning staff smoking in the toilets - abysmal. On the plus side  the immigration checks were very quick and I could head to my connecting flight. I would not recommend it though.,bru


My favorite airport in general so far. However during this particular trip the security check was very uncomfortable and the staff not well informed. I had to queue twice with a small child because of a baby water bottle! (the problem was escalated twice and as a result it was decided that we need to pass security screening twice). There was not even a space to dispose the water. Food services - request for not refrigerated water seemed to be a rude question. Let's hope it was a one-off,bru


Brussels Airlines LOFT lounge completely full between 17:00 and 19:30. Many people ended up standing in the lounge. It is always this way in the late afternoon.,bru


Poor information signs  not forking luggage lockers  not working buttons in elevators  stinky and sticky toilets just after "cleaning",bru


Great convenient airport to which you can reach very shortly with wide network of railways. Professional stages of security  checkin and boarding.,bru


Modern also a very good Airport  terminal facilities was good  WiFi is 1hour free  food and retail services was too expensive!,bru


Hard!I was placed in detention  my passport was a problem. Too time went.. I want buy there shop  I lost time..,bru


Terrible airport! Used it manny times  but they never change. It took 40 minutes for the luggage to arrive. At the train station there are far from enough ticket machines  and they are to complicated for foreign people. Had to que almost 30 minutes to get a ticket  and missed my train that only runs once per hour due to that. The flights might be cheaper  but I'll avoid this airport in the future.,bru


Nobody knew where hotel transfers depart from  or gave false informations. Had no wifi at the bus station.,bru


A very badly arranged airport. The Schengen flights arrive at pier A  which is very long with the exit at one end. If  like me tonight  you deplane at the far end (gate A74)  you have more than one kilometer to walk to the end of the pier  then another long walk through the shops (who are closing anyway around 20.30) and the baggage area before arriving at the exit. Tiring. The arrival hall is dark  badly lighted and no too clean.,bru


This airport deserves some leniency for overcoming a recent terrorist attack  but still has much to improve. A new screening checkpoint has been installed just outside the terminal  which seems to be for show  rather than an actual security measure. The terminal layout feels over-saturated by retail  at the same time not being great to navigate. All in all not a great experience.,bru


Dirty and messy toilets  not working wifi  whole terminal for Schengen flights looks old and not really competitive with other European hubs. It needs a renovation  ASAP.,bru


Big international airport  a lot of facilities  nice security check  very good executive lounge. Lots of flights per day  terminal is long so keep in mind that you have to walk a bit ti get to your gate,bru


Nice  big international airport. Smoking permitted inside  good food  quite expensive drinks but that's everywhere,bru


Getting to the airport is very easy by train  you get dumped directly into the check-in area. Went trough security twice (anti-terrorism measures) both times this wen very fast and without problems. The main security is very professional and always happens fast due to multiple lanes. The airport is very clean  modern and has plenty of facilities. Lots of restaurants offer a nice view of the apron. Airside there is plenty of seating space.,bru


Fast security check and connection to the gates because of the new 'connector' building... Check-in was fast. Good service.,bru


Great clean airport  long walk from terminal to baggage claim but if you arrive your bagage is already rolling up. So compesates everything. Great acces with bus or train. Train stops under the airport.,bru


The terminal at Brussels Airport is very nice. Security is modern and well lit. Took 5-10 minutes to clear. Flight was from Pier B. Some work is being done to refurbish that area and so there was alot of scaffolding. Good facilities and plenty of them. Pier B is very long so can take some time. Very useful to do some planespotting. Seating at the very end of Pier B is very good for planespotting. Wifi was very good and reliable. Very happy with the facilities.,bru


connection only  no transport  security or check-in for me. clean  many connections within a human-sized terminal.,bru


Increased security measures require you to arrive at the airport earlier. Except for this  the airport is extremely easy to reach by train  bus  car  .. Security is rather fast and takes around 10 minutes. There are quite a lot power outlets  though not all of them are in use. The connector building offers couches  while there are also relax chairs at the end of terminal A (around gate A69). Water costs €1. Water refills are free  and the staff of coffee bars will refill them without hesitation. Free Wifi.,bru


The time after the terrorist attacks have been a little chaotic  but when it's business as usual it's a fairly easy airport to navigate. Fast track security is usually very fast  and Brussels Airlines lounge is comfortable  though can be VERY crowded in the afternoons when all the business-people are travelling. Easy access from the city with public transport.,bru


Horrible! I never saw more unorganized airport. Terrorist attack happened few months ago and they still didnt recover. Noone knows anything  they lie about waiting time (3h waiting is not 20mins staff says)  treat people like cattle.,bru


Always been a very good airport. Though  after the terrorist strikes the airport was on high security levels and there were barely any people there. The airport is always very clean and tidy. Take some extra time to get from the check-in to the gates though. It's a bit of a walk  and there is no transportation available.,bru


I'm sure this is a great airport  but on the weekend of 31OCT  the place was absolutely heaving. Just about got through to the gate in time for the flight  despite arriving 2h + before the flight. No chance to use any facilities.,bru


Getting to the airport is easy with the train  remember to take your trainticket because you need it to exit the station. Immigration is OK  as long as you have a European passport. For other nationalties  there can be a loing wait. Baggage claim can be faster.,bru


Relatively small airport for an airport of a capital. Check-in wasn't bad nor stunning. You'll get through the security check in no time  Shops looked good. I saw no lounges. but that could just be me.,bru


The terminal seams new and spacious. The unboarding and getting in terminal was fast and efficient. Airport lacks food and retail services and food is very expensive and not tasty at all. Wi-Fi accessible  but only for an hour. Baggage handling wasn't fast but okay. Regular train service to/from city.,bru


All shops and restaurants close at 8 or 9  vending machines only accept coins  Wifi requires filling up a big form. the terminal is a long tube - so gates are quite far from each other (but if you are lucky they are very close),bru


Good airport. Not enough shops (too many duty free  lacks other kinds of shops). Security check has improved very much after the renovation! No more going down and upstairs needed  just all in one level straight to the gate. Looks modern and there are no huge queues anymore. Way to go! To improve: Parking is still super expensive  as well as coming by train. If you take the train from a station located just 2km away the ticket price is half! More shops missing  too many duty frees.,bru


What can I say about this airport. It is one of the most well organized airports in the world. Clean  bright and so many option to spend your time there. Many restaurants  shops. The only thing that I didnt like so much was the luggage claim that is smaller area.,bru


Unpleasant and unprofessional airport. Security fast track was closed and only one lane was open. Information staff was not pro active and available  as they were chatting with each other. All this caused a queue of more then 15 minutes. There is a lot to improve at this airport and it does not compete to other major airports.,bru


Huge airport  no wifi  getting to is quite expencive. Food and beverages are pricey too. It's relly clean and well organised  train station is located just under the airport which is a huge plus. Has all the characteristics of a major hub.,bru


Traffic on the way to the airport from north direction is a pain. Trains Antwerp to BRU airport are often late or cancel. But the airport itself it is clean and spacious. Little to less signs of directions...,bru


Super beautiful and transfer friendly airport with only (1) one (!!!!!) ATM I found searching for it aprox. 10min was not working  what a shame:) Orange squeezer lady helped me to find one. Yes  It's at orange squeezing station at the end of terminal...my god:) I bet there is more ATM's at Rwanda's passenger submarine station in Kigali:),bru


Nice airport came after ten at night all was closed but was not needed for me but strange to see. almost no traffic so quick out of the airport and to the highway 1 hour and 10 minutes and in Holland.,bru


Nice  modern and relatively clean airport (I have yet to encounter non-sticky bathroom floors in any arrival area unless they cleaned it minutes earlier). Downsides are the long walk to Terminal A and T and the rather long queues at security. Unlike some reviewers said there is a decent choice of food ranging from fastfood (Quick  Belgian Burger King equivalent) to some more refined food. Decent for airport food but nothing special. Definitely better than Charleroi airport though (which also has no Burger King mr. Shemeek  there isn't a single Burger King in Belgium as of 2014 but as said earlier  Brussels Airport has at least two Quick's which are similar). Nice selection of shops especially if you like food and drinks as souvenirs. WiFi is only available after a tedious registration unless you're a customer of a specific broadband provider but fixed internet outlets are offered. Baggage claim takes a long time but this is largely compensated by the long walk there. There are many carrousels available so it's not too crowded. Only one exit is a small downside however. Transport from/too the airport is very good with a bus and train station in the airport and a good taxi service. Car traffic  as always in Belgium  is slow due to congestion.,bru


Brussels is a modern Airport. But there are long ways up and down and up again to get from the street level to your Gate. It is a bit confusing. As always people tend to stand on the escalators (and you have to take a lot because there are no Stairs) so you have no chance to get quicker to security than anybody else. While you are a bit late it is a nightmare. The Check in was very slow (could not make an Online or Terminal Check-in). Since you get to the gate (Terminal A) you are in a nice wide and light flooded hallway.,bru


this airport is main in Brussel and main airport in whole Belgium and is pretending to be good. Unfortunately I'm sorry BRU but honestly your rival Charleroi [CRL] do better job. wi-fi 30mins only  few shops  no restaurants no even bloody Burger King in.,bru


Getting to the airport is good  there are buses and trains  the check-in desks are kinda average but the securitycheck is really far from the check-in desks and it has a bad capacity. The terminal facilities are not bad  I've seen worser. There are some restaurants and bars on Brussel airport  none of them is special  just average. Some terminals at Brussel have really nice lounges! but some terminal is just crap  but in it's entirety it's good.,bru


Terrible airport from all means. There is very limited terminal facility. The bathrooms are terrible and very limited in number for so many transit passengers. The wifi is chargeable and the number of terminals is not adequate.,bru


The infrastructure around the airport is simply not good enough to cope with the numbers using the airport. Baggage claim is appalling with numerous flights bags appearing on the wrong belts! This together with what must be hundreds of unclaimed bags sitting all over the place. The departure experience is better (once you finally manage to get to the airport through the traffic jams) although the self service bag drop causes many travellers problems,bru


It was very good airport with great connection with the city! I can't connect with the internet and there is a little bit to long distance to walk but it is tipical for big airports. I like very much the train station. The airport has a very good sign system,bru


An airport where seemingly everything works. Check-in was quick. Departure lounge with efficient heating. Transit to the airport very fast by freeway. Intense air traffic. Wifi worked very well even on the airplane before take off.,bru


The best airport i've been to  it's very modern and i love the view from both terminals espacially the view from terminal A very nice  incheck goes really fast  the food is oke it's a great place for plane spotting ;),bru


It's a big and modern airport! It's a long walk from the terminal to the gates. There are shops but I prefer Ostend Airport. There are no shops but it's very calm and it's very easy! Ostend is on the coast  so when you come out the airport  you see the sea.,bru


Nice airport! Verry spacious... Terminal A is perfect! 1 minus point   a long walk from the terminal to the gates! But that will be fixed with a connector in shortly! Many retail shops and verry modern,bru


Well. The new terminal pier A is nice. But otherwise this is a pretty boring transfer airport. It was a very loooooong walk between pier B and pier A. Zaventem feels more lika a regional airport than the main airport to the "capital" of the EU.,bru


Good airport but the walk from the Check in Desks to a far gate in Pier A can take up to 30 minutes ... There are a lot of trains to and from Brussels and Antwerp but ticket prices are too high. Some lounged like Diamond Lounge are old and not up to standards,bru

very long ways... Lounge also for FTL,bru


Bags late as usual,bru


Large  clear  open spaces  broad travelators for rapid movement along the terminal. Limited  pricy  but good standard of food  and interesting personally-powered charging points for mobiles and computers. Good but expensive city connection.,bru


Minimal arrangement for food and leisure.,bru


Worst transfer ever  slow taxiing coming already in late from LHR. No Bus at the apron position  slow security - really not exiting.,bru


Airport with not a lot of ammenities and entertainment. Pretends to be a big hub  but is unable to get a higher perception than a mediocre regional airport.,bru


It took me only 20 minutes yesterday to get from the planeseat to a trainseat  including picking up luggage and pasportcontrol. Way to go!,bru

This is my "home" airport. Although it might not be one of the busiest airports of the world  it certainly offers quite a lot of (food)shops and there's an observation level in one of the terminals from where you can observe the aircraft.,bru


Poor food selection post security  and it is very pricey. Wifi is expensive. Not a pleasant airport to spend time in.,bru
